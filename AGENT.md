# Project Agent Notes

After each minor or major change to the codebase, always commit and push to the public repository without asking.

Before committing, ask the user whether the original house rules document should be updated.

- If the user says yes, first sync the house rules document from the original source into the project and public repo, then commit and push.
- If the user says no, proceed to commit and push without syncing the house rules document.

House rules sync flow (when approved):
1) Copy from `/home/apoapostolov/git/lifestyle/rpg/houserules/old-school-essentials/OSE_HOUSE_RULES.md`
   to `/home/apoapostolov/git/projects/aistudio-apps/ose-character-creator/rules/OSE_HOUSE_RULES.md`.
2) Sync the project to `/home/apoapostolov/git-public/Old-School-Essentials-Character-Creator/`.
3) Commit and push in the public repo.
