# House rules changelog

## 2026-01-18 (v1.3.4)

- MINOR: Paladin — Added Smite Evil (natural 20 max damage + extra roll; expands to natural 19 at 9th level and natural 18 at 14th).

## 2026-01-07 (v1.3.3)

- MINOR: Smooth Attack Progression — Replaced all per-class THAC0 tables with three unified progressions: Warrior (+9 at L14), Adventurer (+7 at L14), and Mage/Sage (+5 at L14). Progressions advance in gradual +1 steps, matching traditional caps, and demi-human classes plateau at max levels but retain the final bonus beyond.
- MINOR: Masterwork Weapons and Armor — Added rules for finely crafted non-magical items: masterwork weapons (+1 to hit only, ×3 cost, +1 SV vs. sunder/rust/acid), masterwork armor (+1 AC only, ×5 cost). Distinguished from magical items which provide full bonuses to hit/damage or AC and improved saving throws. Magical weapons/armor also gain +1 SV vs. sunder/rust/acid (+X for magical items).

## 2026-01-03 (v1.3.2)

- MINOR: Social Standing — Added rules for Karameikos social hierarchy and gating to literacy.

- MINOR: Grogs — Reworked; added bond/economics/one-time rules.
- PATCH: Encumbrance — Clarified hireling/retainer pooled inventory with quantum state rules for critical items and loss mechanics.

## 2025-12-31 (v1.3.0)

## 2025-12-28 (v1.2.0)

- MAJOR: Removed old Carousing rules.
- MINOR: Cleric — Added Faith's Influence.
- MINOR: Half-Orc — Grim Tenacity now requires a saving throw versus Death to act while at 0 hp; on failure, the Half-Orc drops and begins dying as normal.
- MINOR: Svirnefblin — Tuned to mid‑high tier: added Stone Camouflage (4‑in‑6 when motionless against stone), enhanced Gem Sense (evaluate value, detect illusion; sense gem veins within 30'), and Sure‑Footed (half fall damage on stone/earth; save vs Breath to catch a rocky edge).
- MINOR: Halfling — Added Underfoot Defense: creatures larger than human-sized suffer −1 to hit Halflings in melee.
- MINOR: Halfling — Added Stout Heart: +2 to saving throws versus magical effects that charm, dominate, possess, or compel action against their nature (stacks with racial save bonuses).
- MINOR: Half‑Elf — Diplomat improved: once per encounter, may reroll a Morale check during parley/negotiation if the situation is not outright hostility; the new result stands.
- MINOR: Half‑Elf — Added See Through Pretense: 1-in-6 chance to passively detect lies, disguises, or hidden motives during conversation.

## 2025-11-16 (v1.1.0)

- MAJOR: Added new Combat rules: Running in Combat, Subduing Damage (non-lethal attacks), Shooting Attacks Past Creatures, Change Weapon and Attack (draw penalties), Defensive Stance/Parry, and Cover an Ally.
- MINOR: Added Knight "Shield Stand" stance: Knight may declare a Shield Stand (forfeits movement) to increase shield benefits to +2 AC and +1 to Parry for the Knight and adjacent allies wielding shields until the start of the Knight's next turn.
- MINOR: Starting Health update: typically uncivilized races that live in harsh conditions or oppressive societies (for example, orcs and Drow) now start with a d6 racial hit die.
- MINOR: Fire Damage update: Burning oil now deals an initial 1d6 of burning damage that degrades over time (1d6 → 1d4 → extinguished) depending on the damage rolls and actions taken; dropping items or going prone reduces the die faster; multiple oil flasks reset the burn die and duration; magical oil may start at a higher die.
- MINOR: Added Bleeding Damage mechanic: weapons with the Bleeding quality cause the Bleeding condition on a natural 20 or on maximum damage; Bleeding deals 1 damage at the end of the target's turn and requires a Constitution check to stop.
