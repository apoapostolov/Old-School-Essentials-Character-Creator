## Converting Old-School D&D to Modern Days

**Ascending AC:** Your ascending AC is equal to 19 minus your descending AC. For example leather armor class of 7 equals AC 12 for modern d20 + To Hit vs. AC attack rolls.

**To Hit Bonus:** Your To Hit bonus is equal to 19 minus your THAC0. For example level 1 Fighter has a THAC0 of 19, and their To Hit bonus equals +0 for modern d20 + To Hit vs. AC attack rolls.

## Rolling Scores

Scores are rolled 3d6 in order, no exceptions. You can adjust scores afterwards; see below.

Each player rolls three separate sets of scores and writes them down; the DM will collect unused sets and share them among all players. Any player may opt to take an unused set of scores from another player if their own set of scores does not match their expectation. When a character dies and a new one has to be created, three set of scores are rolled as well but the two unused are discarded.

## Adjust Scores

Reduce an ability score by 2 to gain 1 adjustment point; you may reduce each score once. Spend 1 adjustment point to increase an ability score by +1.

## Starting Health

All human and common demi-human characters of civilized settlements and civilizations in the world have an extra 1d4 hit die, called racial hit die and rolled upon character creation. Uncivilized races that live in harsh conditions or have oppressive societies (for example, Orcs and Drow) start with a d6 racial hit die. Other races may have racial hit die based on size (tiny 1, small 1d2, large 1d8, huge 2d6), or age (human child 1, human teen 1d2). For monsters, this racial health is part of their Hit Dice as indicated in their stat block. Characters, typically commoners without a class, only rely on these racial hit points. The racial hit points have a minimum of 1 hit point.

All characters that start at 1st level or higher in a class take maximum hit points from their class hit die at 1st level. At higher levels, class Hit Dice are rolled as normal.

When you roll a hit die to increase hit points at gaining a higher level, you may reroll the result if it rolls 1 or 2. You may reroll only once, and you take the new result.

## Starting Spells

When creating a new character with Arcane or Divine Spellcasting, the player must choose four player-favorite spells of the first level and roll d4 to randomly pick which spell they start with. The choice can be made only from the **Player’s Tome;** unique and custom spells exist, but they must be found or researched during the game. If the player does not like the rolled result, they can take Sleep (as an arcane spellcaster) or Cure Light Wounds (as a divine spellcaster).

If they know more than one beginning spell (**Advanced Spell Book Rules**, pg. 124), they must roll randomly for those bonus spells on the complete list for any spell level they can cast, using an appropriately sized die (d6, d8, or d12). Duplicate rolls are rerolled until each beginner spell is unique.

**When a Magic User or Cleric attains a new level that adds new slots or unlocks access to a new spell level, they do not get a free spell like in modern-sensibilities games.** They must find a teacher or site of worship and access to scrolls, spell books, or holy texts to gain a new spell via copying. Alternatively, they may research the spell, which typically costs 1000 gp per spell level and takes two weeks of training, practice, or devout worship.

> Unlike later editions of D&D, Clerics and Druids do not receive access to every spell available to their level, and must seek out and develop spells though similar methods like the Magic User, like discovering scrolls or caches of knowledge (holy texts or dolmens of wisdom, in their case). To partially remedy this, in-world monasteries and druid circles often serve as places where Clerics and Druids can share all collected knowledge within their religion, cult, or circle; unlike Magic Users and Illusionists who are typically selfish and paranoid of each other. Unlike spending money to research and learn new spells in such way, Clerics and Druids may choose to engage in Philanthropy for the same value, or take on quests and service to further the goals of the local temple or druid circle.

## Alignment

The meaning of alignment has changed. Lawful and Chaotic represent powerful inclinations that align your character with the otherworldly forces of Law and Chaos, and actions that conflict with your alignment are considered anathema. Alignment anathema may still be transgressed under duress but requires character development and atonement for your acts, which is unnecessary for neutral characters. Extraordinary roleplay of your alignment may grant you divine interventions or a role in the grand conflict between powers of Law and Chaos. Alignment languages are no longer languages but the ability to sense the motive and context of a character’s actions of the exact alignment. You only must choose a Lawful alignment if you play a Paladin, and you are expected to act as Lawful (but may be Neutral in secret) if you are Cleric.

Most humans and demi-humans are neutral by birth, driven by their self-centered needs and personal goals. Even among adventurers, about 70% of all characters will be neutral; if you wish to leave it to chance, make a d20 roll and pick another alignment if you roll 15+. The frequency is as low as 95% among non-adventurers and ordinary men; roll for a natural 20 if you make an ordinary character. Lawful Clerics (and similar classes with alignment requirements, except for Paladins) can choose to be Neutral but are required by their stature to pretend to be Lawful. Such characters may never benefit from Divine Interventions and similar extraordinary circumstances.

## Encumbrance

Use flat coin weight (cn) with clear movement thresholds. Strength modifies the first three thresholds. The 1,600 cn threshold is an absolute maximum. Above 1,600 cn you are Overburdened and can only step or crawl (5') as long as you take no other action.

Base Thresholds

| Encumbrance (cn) | Movement   |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Up to 400        | 120' (40') |
| Up to 600        | 90' (30')  |
| Up to 800        | 60' (20')  |
| Up to 1,600      | 30' (10')  |

Strength Modifiers (applied to 400/600/800 only)

| Strength   | Threshold Modifier |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 18         | +50%               |
| 16-17      | +30%               |
| 13–15      | +15%               |
| 8–12       | +0%                |
| 5–7        | -25%               |
| 4 or lower | -40%               |

You must manage two (or three, during exploration) levels of equipment weight during play, and calculate movement rate for each cumulatively:

- Your armor, personal weapons and worn items (often magical, and typically of negligible weight) that you must carry at all times, except during rest when medium and heavy armor must be taken off to afford comfortable rest (you may sleep in armor should you prefer but you recover no hp from that rest). These items affect your movement rate during combat. Typically items up to 10cn per unit can be worn in pockets, belts and pouches, and be immediately available as part of the action, as long as you can spare one hand or more (up to the DM).
- Your backpack and all items that can be immediately dropped at the start of combat as a free action unless surprised, are assumed to be immediately dropped and left unattended during combat unless you decide otherwise. You typically would decide otherwise if having to flee risks leaving behind expensive equipment or treasure, or unexpected enemy could steal an item while you are engaged in combat. It takes a full round of action to take something out of your backpack, plus your two hands must be free. Remember that having this equipment on you at all times is a liability and may prevent you from fleeing if it modifies your movement rate to worse than your enemies, or below that of your allies.
- Any equipment that is not carried on you but uses a beast of burden or means of transportation (a horse, a carriage) and is typically not part of your equipment, but can be accessed easily during exploration. It takes full round of action to take something out of a saddle or rummage in a load on a carriage, plus your two hands must be free.

For simplicity, hireling and retainers inventory is managed as a single pool. You choose a specific movement rate that your retainers must maintain at all times (typically same as the party) and pool their available carry capacity as a single pool inventory that you manage outside your player characters. You may assign some items as "critical" and your hirelings will know that these items must be made available to you during combat, or must be protected at all costs. Your hirelings will make sure to spend actions to use these items as instructed, spend their turn to follow you and hand you over the items, or protect the items from any threat. The DM has a final say what items can be classified as critical. Each retainer has access to all items in the pool in a quantum state, as long as it makes sense for simplicity, and the DM may intervene and prevent that rule when it no longer makes sense.

Should a retainer flee due to morale, perish due to loss of hit points, or inventory is dropped on the ground, the equipment lost is in quantum state until it is needed or recounted. Should you need to check state of equipment after loss of hireling-carried equipment, there is 2-in-6 chance the item is affected. This chance drops to 1-in-6 for critical items. This check is made up to three times per lost hireling that is included in the equipment pool. These checks are never made for equipment carried by player characters, so keep the most valuable items on them at all times.

## Rolling Dice

Any specific X-in-6 check and Skill Check (d20 under one of the six scores, or a class feature percentile check) is rolled only once per encounter, and for the whole party. There is no "individual checks" where the chance of success is multiplied by the number of individuals in the party, unless one person failing an individual check may fail the whole group, as decided by the DM.

Normally every character has a 1-in-6 chance to succeed at any common activity that doesn't require a skill check or a trained proficiency; such as listening or searching. Once a X-in-6 check is made, it cannot be repeated by another character. The rolled result represent the luck of the moment, not the luck of the individual. On a failure, compare the value across all characters not distracted with another activity. Another character may succeed using the rolled value that a character has failed with (such as rolling 2 for Listen check may be failure for a human, but a success for an Elf). If the value is 1 and everyone would succeed, the person who showed narrative initiative is the first to succeed. If the value is 2 or more and one or more other characters would succeed, the other characters succeed and the information is first revealed to them.

Where the outcome of a X-in-6 roll is unknown (such as listening, or searching for hidden treasure or wall passages) the roll is always made by the DM in secret. The party may spend additional time (typically a minimum of 2 extra turns, 2 extra hours, or an extra half day) to repeat the activity as a group. If they do, the chance of the party increases from the base X-in-6 by +1, +2 or even +3 for each time increase. This may allow the party to succeed against the rolled value, held in secret by the DM, but the party can never know for certain. The DM reveals the success once enough time has been committed to the activity to match the rolled result.

The same principles are applied to "roll under score" skill checks that use skills and training proficiencies, or a roll of a percentile die for class heroic skills. If a character asks to make a skill check rolling d20 under one of the six basic scores, or roll a d100 percentile dice, the rolled value becomes the luck of the moment. Even if they fail, another character may succeed if their base score is equal or above the rolled value, and they share the same training proficiencies. Typically the party should investigate any opportunities to use circumstances and tools to get bonuses to their scores before rolling the die in order to increase their chances.

> 👁️ If the Party fails a 1-in-6 check, any Thief in the party can treat their class feature percentile skill as a second chance. This check is once again “a luck of the moment” and the value is shared between multiple thieves in the party, where one with a higher level may succeed over one of lower level.

## Grogs

Any player character who is a purely a spellcaster (Cleric, Druid, Illusionist, and the Magic User; the DM may approve one for the Gnome as well) may choose to start their career with a grog, a loyal starting hireling sworn to assist and protect them during their early days of adventuring. The grog is typically a 1 HD Level 0 Fighter (or equivalent class-appropriate hireling, such as an animal companion for Druids/Rangers or an apprentice for pure spellcasters like Magic Users or Illusionists, subject to DM approval). The grog's hit dice is rolled normally as for L0 Class character (not maximized like leveled hirelings).

- **Bond & Role**: Players should establish a strong motivation and backstory bond between the PC and grog (e.g., family retainer, indebted mercenary, faithful hound). The grog prioritizes the PC's safety, carrying critical gear and acting as a dedicated bodyguard or utility hireling. The grog benefits from +2 Morale bonus due to sworn loyalty.
- **Economics**: No wage required, but the grog must be **treated fairly** (adequate rations, rest, no suicidal orders), and failure risks Morale checks change from +2 to -2. The Grog receives a **half-share of treasure** and earns XP from the hireling pool (the first 100 XP earned convert it to L1 hireling with maximized HP from its first class Hit Die).
- **You Only Get One Grog:** If the grog dies, it is **not replaced.** You must hire normally thereafter.

| Class Flavor Examples      | Grog Type Examples                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cleric**                 | Devout acolyte or templar initiate.                                 |
| **Magic User/Illusionist** | A sworn bodyguard, paying magic service debt.                       |
| **Druid**                  | Loyal animal (wolf, hawk; favored terrain animal with 1 HD).        |
| **Gnome**                  | A cousin who cares greatly for you, and won’t let you travel alone. |

## Social Standing in Karameikos

Now, we determine where your character is from — both his "home town" and the social standing of his family. Roll percentile dice (1d100) and compare the result to the chart below. This will tell you the economic standing of the family your character comes from.

| Range | Standing                                  | Literacy Checks | Starting Gold Modifier |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 01–30 | Penniless                                 | 1               | –30%                   |
| 31–60 | Struggling                                | 1               | –15%                   |
| 61–75 | Comfortable                               | 2               | +0% (standard)         |
| 76–85 | Wealthy/Untitled                          | 2               | +20%                   |
| 86–95 | Wealthy/Titled Noble (minimum for Knight) | 3               | +40%                   |
| 96–97 | Very Wealthy/Untitled                     | 3               | +65%                   |
| 98–99 | Very Wealthy/Titled Noble                 | 4               | +95%                   |
| 00    | Royal Family                              | 4               | +150%                  |

The lowest class is "Penniless." There is no slavery in Karameikos. When you roll your Family Background, write down the number you rolled; you'll use it again momentarily.

### Ethnos

Roll 1d100 and add ½ of your previous Family Social Standing roll (round down). Higher results indicate families that are generally wealthier and closer in status/culture to the ruling Thyatian elite.

In canon of the Grand Duchy of Karameikos, pure **Thyatians** make up roughly 10-15% of the human population but dominate the upper classes (nobility, administration, wealth). To reflect this, the top ~10% of results (modified rolls of 141+) are **Thyatian** families. All lower results are **local** (one of the ethnos below). You can ignore the result from this table, it is mainly rolled for authenticity.

| Range  | Origin    | Description Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01-10  | Stiganos  | Nomadic artisans, metalworkers, musicians, animal traders (1-3% of population). Lowest status; widespread superstition-based prejudice against them. Mobile katuns, tight-knit clans, bright clothing, gesture-based secret language.                                                                     |
| 11-25  | Derevei   | Scattered forest dwellers, hunters, trappers, herbalists (4-6%). Live in small winter settlements, share resources communally, reclusive and suspected of dealings with forest spirits. Dark hides, long hair tied to ancient oaks.                                                                       |
| 26-45  | Vlastari  | Mountain clans, shepherds (8-12%). Clan honor, ancient rites, blood oaths, superstitious. Sheepskins, generational daggers, oral poetic tradition. Often viewed as rough and prone to old pagan ways.                                                                                                     |
| 46-70  | Sarapi    | Hill and river valley folk, farmers, soldiers, mercenaries (25-30%). Fiery temperament, strong family loyalties, proud of ancient heritage. Layered wool, embroidered holiday dress, rough dialect with Hin borrowings.                                                                                   |
| 71-95  | Polanitsi | Traders, horse breeders, grain farmers around larger settlements (12-18%). Open to the world, value long-distance travel ("hadjuvane"), guild networks, adoption common. Riding tunics, shaved heads or warrior braids, mercantile cant. High commercial wealth.                                          |
| 96-140 | Slavani   | Most numerous (35-40%), farmers, craftsmen, small merchants. Well-integrated into Karameikan administration; many ruling clans are of Slavani blood. Plain white cloths, embroidered festive shirts, clear Traladaran speech. Political and administrative elite among Traladarans.                       |
| 141+   | Thyatian  | Immigrant or descendant families from the Thyatian Empire. Predominantly urban, cosmopolitan, often aristocratic or mercantile. Tanned skin, varied hair/eye colors, short hair for men, practical but elegant clothing. Hold most noble titles and high offices; court language and culture is Thyatian. |

### Literacy in Karameikos

In the traditional society of the Grand Duchy of Karameikos, literacy remains a privilege largely confined to the educated elite. Most knowledge is preserved and transmitted orally through folklore, epic tales, songs, and family traditions. Practical literacy is commonplace only among merchants, tradesmen, administrators, and those involved in governance or trade with the Thyatian Empire. To determine a character’s literacy level, make a number of **Ability Checks under Intelligence** equal to the value shown in the Family Social Standing table. Each successful check grants one Literacy Success.

**Special Adjustments:**

- Barbarians and Druids receive **one fewer check** than indicated.
- Clerics, Magic-Users, and Illusionists automatically gain **one free Literacy Success** (added after all checks are resolved). Magic-Users and Illusionists can choose to take Glantrian as their first literate language instead of Traladar. Most imported or spell-books used by travelling magic users prefer to use Glantrian so they aren’t widely used if stolen. Clerics use Monastic Script for the same reason, using so complex caligraphy that it is very hard for normal folk to read.
- Characters from the Royal Family or Thyatian origin are assumed to begin with Thyatian as their primary spoken and written language, and they receive both for free.

### Literacy Effects

| Literacy Successes | Proficiency Level                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0**              | **Illiterate:** Cannot read or write in any language. However, nearly all inhabitants of Karameikos (except Barbarians and Druids, who may require on-the-spot instruction) can recognise basic written symbols through memorisation and cultural exposure—such as common signs (e.g., "Tavern," "Market," "Court") and the denominations of coinage.                                                                                                                     |
| **1**              | **Basic Literacy:** Can read simple texts with ease and write basic messages with a rudimentary grasp of spelling and grammar. Observers fluent in the language can readily identify the writer's limited proficiency. Complex, technical, or formal texts require an Intelligence check at a –2 penalty to comprehend.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **2**              | **Fluent Literacy:** Reads and writes with full comprehension and a competent, stylish prose sufficient to pass as an educated individual in most social and professional contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **3 or more**      | **Advanced Literacy:** In addition to fluent literacy, the character masters one specialised additional script, language, or style of the player’s choice (each additional success beyond the third grants mastery of one further option; no duplicates). You must be able to speak the language that you learn to read and write into, unless you receive it for free from your Family Social Standing, at which point you receive the spoken language as well for free. |

**• Elven Script –** mastery of the elegant, flowing elven writing system (suitable for Callarii or Vyalia dialects; aids in reading ancient elven texts or inscriptions).
**• Dwarven Runes (Dethek) –** proficiency in the angular runic script of the dwarves (common in Rockhome and Highforge/Stronghollow clans; useful for inscriptions on weapons, forges, or clan records).
**• Monastic Calligraphy –** able to read, write, and forge ecclesiastical documents and messages of the Church of Karameikos or Heliocosmos.
**• Thyatian (Formal) –** fluent in official Imperial Thyatian script and style, sufficient to comprehend non-encrypted political, legal, and administrative correspondence.
**• Alasiyan (Ylari) –** the primary language and script of the Emirates of Ylaruam (a desert nation to the north of Karameikos, inspired by medieval Arabic cultures).
**• Glantrian –** one of the major languages and scripts of the Principalities of Glantri (player chooses which, e.g., Alphatian, Flaemish, or Belcadiz).
**• Thieves’ Cant –** secret signs, symbols, and coded phrases commonly used by criminals and operatives of the Iron Ring (also aids in forgeries and veiled communications). |

Improving your character’s Literacy takes a downtime of six months and 500 gp investment, and is typically handled between adventures.

### Social Standing Descriptions (from GAZ1)

**Penniless:** The family is dirt-poor. Most of its members spend all their lives in backbreaking labor. Family members grow up uneducated, working all their lives for someone else’s profit. The character’s “starting gold” represents every coin that the family could scrounge up, save, or steal, and the family is hoping that the character will become wealthy on his adventures and return to help the family. The family owns no property, has practically no possessions and lives in a home of remarkable poverty; family members have ragged clothing, no shoes, no weapon larger than a knife or pitchfork.

**Struggling:** The family is poor. It may own the property it lives on, but does not make a good living from it. Family members work all their lives to very little gain. The character’s “starting gold” represents several years’ worth of scrimping and saving for the head of the household, and the family is hoping that the character will become wealthy on his adventures and return to help the family. The family lives in an inadequate home; family members have limited clothing and only occasionally own shoes or traveling gear; the household head may own a sword but most members of the family have no weapon other than knives or bows.

**Comfortable:** The family is not rich but does not suffer from want. It may own the property on which it lives. It makes a decent living with occasional periods of greater prosperity or financial turmoil. The character’s “starting gold” represents the approximate amount the family gives to every youth leaving for the Sharing. The family is hoping that the character will prove to be a worthy person during the years he spends on his own. The family lives in an adequate home; family members have adequate clothes, including footwear, traveling clothes, and (often) one fine outfit for social wear; most members of the family can afford a weapon of choice.

**Wealthy/Untitled:** The family is wealthy. Its members do not suffer from want. It is likely to own the property on which it lives and other properties besides, and is likely to employ servants. It makes a good living, usually from trade or agriculture or from the earnings of one highly-paid professional in the family.

**Wealthy/Titled:** This is the same as Wealthy/Untitled, except that the head of the family has a title issued by Duke Stefan or other important figures. He will either bear the title Lord (Lady) or Patriarch (Matriarch). A Lord will be the owner of a large tract of land and leader of the communities thereon, or will be a court lord who performs tasks for Duke Stefan. A Patriarch will be the head of a church or an itinerant (traveling) cleric of great importance within the Church.

**Very Wealthy/Untitled:** This is the same as Wealthy/Untitled, except that the family is very wealthy—for instance, the family in charge of an important shipping enterprise or of an important community. The DM will need to decide which family the character is from, choosing from the examples given in this Gazetteer. He might, for instance, decide the character belongs to the Torenescu family of Specularum, a very powerful but untitled clan.

**Very Wealthy/Titled:** This is the same as Wealthy/Titled, except that the family is larger and more important. The head of the clan will be a Baron or a General in the Duke’s service. The DM will need to decide which family the character is from, choosing from appropriate clans. He might, for instance, decide the character belongs to the Kelvin clan of Kelvin or the Vorloi clan of Specularum and Vorloi Village.

**Royal Family:** The character is a member of the Duke’s own family. The DM will decide precisely what relationship the character has to the Duke. He might decide, for instance, that the character is the Duke’s oldest child, or second-oldest, or that the character is a nephew or niece of the Duke. The character will have recently been Sheared and so cannot depend on the royal family for assistance for quite some time. If the character travels about under his own name, he risks kidnapping, murder and subversion attempts.

### Player’s Hometown

Roll **1d20** + modifiers (see below). The final result determines your character’s hometown during their youth. Higher social standing and magical/clerical classes bias toward urban or prominent locations.

## Class Rework

## Basics of Class Rework

Classes are broken into three distinctive groups:

- **Basic Classes:** These include the Cleric, the Fighter, the Magic User, and the Thief. **All Basic Classes have the standard Primary Attribute Requirements of 9.** With minor improvements to their role, these classes are left unchanged.
- **Demihuman Classes:** These include the Drow, the Dwarf, the Duergar, the Elf, the Gnome, the Halfling, the Half-Elf, the Half-Orc, and the Svirnefblin. **Their primary Attribute Requirements are all increased to 11.** These classes are rebalanced with a boost of their unique abilities over human characters. Any class from a third party supplement that is a demihuman class follows the same rules and is a subject of improvement by the DM, if needed.
- **Advanced Classes:** These include the Acrobat, the Assassin, the Barbarian, the Bard, the Druid, the Illusionist, the Knight, the Paladin, and the Ranger. Advanced classes have class-specific requirements (typically one attribute at 13+ and a secondary at 9+). See the requirements table below. Any non-basic class from a third party supplement follows the same rules and is a subject of improvement by the DM, if needed.

For each class, combine the write-up in the **Old School Essentials Advanced Player's Tome** with the changes and additions listed here.

## THAC0 / ToHit progression

Attack roll use the formula: **d20 + Attack Bonus + STR (melee) or DEX (ranged) modifirt ≥ target’s Ascending AC**. These progressions **replace all class THAC0 tables**. They smooth original B/X advances into gradual +1 steps (never more than +1 per level), matching exact final bonuses at traditional caps. Demi-human classes plateau after their max levels but retain the bonus beyond.

| Group          | Final Bonus at 14 | Classes Included                                                           |

## Basic Classes

### Cleric

- **Cure Disease (ritual):** The Cleric can use holy water and prayer to alleviate and stop the spread of disease. The Cleric has a 4-in-6 chance to cure simple diseases and a 2-in-6 chance to cure simple virulent diseases; the check can be repeated daily for normal diseases, or weekly for virulent diseases. The cleric has a 1-in-6 chance to attempt to cure magical or unholy diseases or potent diseases with no known or simple cure; if they can do so, they must use their Turn Undead vs a disease with an HD value decided by the DM (for example, the Black Plague is a 5 HD disease). If Turning is successful, the disease stops developing, and another successful Turning on another day is needed to cure it. If Destruction is successful, the disease is cured. If cured, the patient recovers in 3d6 days after receiving the cure, or half that if they are believers of the same faith or alignment.
- **Holy Sense:** The Cleric can concentrate for one turn on a held item or on an area to tell if it is magical by divine means and whether the item is holy, unholy, or a divine artifact of any alignment, and its properties if the item is holy based on their beliefs. The Cleric can also concentrate on a 30-foot area and tell if it is consecrated or desecrated based on their beliefs. The Cleric can reveal divine artifacts, items made by divinely aligned creatures, intelligent items with an alignment, or cursed items (although the specifics of the curse cannot be revealed).
- **Faith's Influence:** The Cleric's recognized faith grants them authority in social situations, but only with those beneath them in station or order. When making a Reaction check, or a Wisdom or Charisma check against a target who recognizes the Cleric's religion and is not in an authoritative position (such as a peasant, a lower-ranking priesthood member, or a younger acolyte), the Cleric gains +1 to the check. If the target shares the same faith and alignment, the bonus increases to +2. Targets actively hostile to the Cleric's faith may instead suffer a similar penalty at the DM's discretion.

### Fighter

- **Cleave:** The Fighter can cleave through multiple enemies in melee range. On their turn, when the Fighter reduces an enemy to 0 hp with a melee attack, they can make one additional melee attack against another opponent they are engaged with. They learn to cleave twice at 5th level, three times at 9th level, and four times at 13th level. At 9th level, the Fighter can spend one use of cleave to move no more than 10 feet and engage another enemy.

### Magic User

- **Arcane Sense:** The Magic User can concentrate on a held item for one turn to tell if it is magical by arcane means and its properties. Cursed items never reveal their curse until the item is used correctly. If the item is intelligent, the Magic User may confirm that and evaluate a vague approximation of the intelligence (below, at par, or above theirs).

> 👉🏼 The Magic User’s ability to detect magic items does not make the **Read Magic** spell useless. The spell is cast in a round; it identifies things that are not held items, such as terrain and hidden magical traps, and has no limit on the number of items it can detect. Still, the **Read Magic** spell does not identify an item’s properties.

### Thief

- **Skill Progression:** Thief Skills use a modified version of the Optional Thief rules in Carcass Crawler #1 (pg. 28) but converted to support percentile values as supported by the Foundry system.
  - At Level 1, the Thief has a value of 10% in all its skills (25% in Climb) and 1-1 in its Hear Noises Skill. The Thief then distributes 4 increases between these skills. Each increase adds +15% to the skill's percentile value or +1 to the lower value of an X-in-6 for Hear Noises. You may not put more than two increases in the same skill.
  - At gaining a new level, the Thief can distribute two additional increases. You may not put more than one increase in the same skill.
  - Percentile skills cannot exceed a maximum of 85%; value reached with 5 increases. The Hear Noises skill cannot exceed a maximum of 5-in-6; the value reached with 4 increases.

> 🔦 **Environmental Edge:** The Thief may increase their chances in a percentile skill by +10 or +20 if they use environmental factors such as shadows and light sources or engage in competence roleplay of situations where wrong decisions and poor use of real-life knowledge may cause failure.

## Demi-human Classes

The minimum attribute requirement for all demi-human classes is 11.

### Drow

- The Drow racial die is d6.
- **Dark Assassination:** The Drow is trained in the art of assassination in darkness. When attacking in pitch darkness, the Drow benefits from +4 to Attack Roll against unaware or blinded creatures. However, when attacking, the Drow may forfeit this bonus and deal double damage on a successful hit.
- **Dex Finesse (Drow arms):** The Drow is trained in dark-elven combat techniques that emphasize speed and accuracy. When they use weapons made by Drow, they can choose to have their Dexterity Bonus, rather than their Strength Bonus, added to the Attack and Damage Rolls.
- **Poisoncraft (spiders):** The Drow can spend a day in the company of friendly poisonous giant spiders of 1 HD or more and produce 1d3 uses of Bloodstream Poison Type I or Ingested Poison Type II. For each 3 HD above the first in spider hit dice, increase the type of poisons by one type category. The Drow cannot repeat the process with the same spider population in a week.
- **Sleep/Paralysis Immunity:** The Drow's **Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis** has been changed to **Immunity to Sleep and Paralysis.** Spells or creature attacks cannot put the Drow to sleep or paralyze them. However, they can be petrified by creatures such as Basilisks or Medusas.
- **Sylvan Sense:** The Drow can concentrate for one turn on a held item to determine its magical status by arcane means but cannot reveal its properties; only a Magic User, Illusionist, and sometimes a Cleric can do this.

### Dwarf

- **Stout Fortune:** Once per day, the Dwarf can reroll a failed saving throw versus Death or Poison, Paralysis or Petrification, or Spells (but not Rods and Staves).
- **Hardy Growth:** The Dwarf gains +1 hit point every time they level up after 1st level. The Dwarf rolls their hit dice twice when leveling up and chooses the higher result (and can still reroll a result of 1 or 2 once).
- The Dwarf has **Attack Giant Foes**. Against giant opponents (larger than human-sized), they benefit from +2 to attack rolls.

### Duergar

- **Iron Will:** Once per day, the Duergar can reroll a failed saving throw versus Poison or Spells.
- **Stone Stealth:** Duergar's Stealth applies to all stone-made interiors with exposed rough stonework, not just underground.
- **Harm Giant Foes:** Against giant opponents (larger than human-sized), they benefit from +2 to damage.

### Elf

- **Low-Light Vision:** The Elf loses **Infra-vision 90'**. Among elves, it is available only to the Drow. The Elf gains Low-Light Vision (see [Low-Light Vision](https://www.notion.so/Low-Light-Vision-47b310049e314f2bbbe5c4294fe904f3?pvs=21)).
- The Elf’s **Arcane Magic** grants it access to the spell lists of both the Magic User and Illusionist. The Elf also gains two additional Beginner Spells, rolled as normal.
- **Elven Finesse:** The Elf is trained in elven combat techniques that emphasize speed and accuracy. When using weapons made by elves, the Elf can choose to have their Dexterity Bonus, rather than their Strength Bonus, added to the Attack and Damage Rolls.
- The Elf’s **Detect Secret Doors** is changed to **Detect Secrets**. The Elf has a 2-in-6 chance to detect hidden objects when actively searching. The Elf’s cunning intuition also has a 1-in-6 chance of knowing whether someone is keeping a secret from them, even without fact-checking. However, the Elf does not automatically know what the secret might be.
- **Sleep/Paralysis Immunity:** The Elf's **Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis** is changed to **Immunity to Sleep and Paralysis.** The Elf cannot be put to sleep or paralyzed by spells or creature attacks. However, they can be petrified by creatures such as Basilisks or Medusas.
- **Sylvan Sense:** The Elf can concentrate for one turn on a held item to determine its magical status by arcane means but cannot reveal its properties; only a Magic User, Illusionist, and sometimes a Cleric can do this.

### Gnome

- **Blink Away:** Once per day, when the Gnome takes damage from an enemy, they may become invisible until the start of their next turn or until they receive damage again before their next turn.
- The Gnome's **Arcane Magic** allows them to choose between the Magic User and Illusionist spell lists. The choice is made upon character creation and cannot be changed later.
- **Terrain Hiding:** The Gnome has a 4-in-6 chance to Hide in a densely forested environment, a 3-in-6 chance to hide in a crowded urban environment, and a 2-in-6 chance to Hide in a natural dungeon or furnished interior environment, and 1-in-6 chance if none of these apply. As long as enough cover is available, the Gnome can hide and remain hidden while they take no action. The chances increase by 1 if done in pitch darkness or under moonlight. The Gnome can remain hidden for 1d3 rounds; it must repeat the check to extend the period by an additional 1d3 rounds.

### Halfling

- **Lucky:** The Halfling is born lucky. Once per day, they can reroll a failed saving throw or a d6 check to Hide (see below).
- **Stout Heart:** Halflings gain +2 to saving throws versus magical effects that charm, dominate, possess, or compel action against their nature. This stacks with their racial save bonuses.
- **Terrain Hiding:** The Halfling has a 5-in-6 chance to Hide in a densely forested environment, a 4-in-6 chance to hide in a crowded urban environment, and a 3-in-6 chance to Hide in a natural dungeon or furnished interior environment, and 1-in-6 chance if none of these apply. As long as enough cover is available, the Halfling can hide and remain hidden while they take no action. The Halfling can remain hidden for 1d3 rounds; it must repeat the check to extend the period by an additional 1d3 rounds.
- **Underfoot Defense:** Creatures larger than human-sized suffer -1 to hit the Halfling in melee.

### Half-Elf

- **Low-Light Vision:** The Half-Elf loses **Infra-vision 90'**, among all elves it is available only on the Drow. The Half-Elf gains Low-Light Vision (see [Low-Light Vision](https://www.notion.so/Low-Light-Vision-47b310049e314f2bbbe5c4294fe904f3?pvs=21))
- **Mixed Finesse:** The Half-Elf is trained in elven combat techniques that emphasize speed and accuracy. When using weapons made by elves or humans, the Half-Elf can choose to have their Dexterity Bonus, rather than their Strength Bonus, added to the Attack and Damage Rolls.
- **See Through Pretense:** Living between two cultures grants the Half-Elf keen insight into deception. The Half-Elf has a 1-in-6 chance to passively detect lies, disguises, or hidden motives during conversation, no action required.
- **Keen Awareness:** Half-Elves are wary observers, rarely caught off guard. When the party is surprised, the Half-Elf rolls 1d6 and is only surprised on 1-3 (50% chance to act normally during surprise rounds).
- **Diplomat:** The Half-Elf is a born diplomat. The Half-Elf gains +1 to Reaction Rolls from all creatures that do not bear hatred towards humans or elves. Once per encounter, if a Morale check is called during parley or negotiation and the situation is not outright hostility (e.g., attack immediately), the Half-Elf may reroll that Morale check and must take the new result.
- **Sleep/Paralysis Immunity:** The Half-Elf's **Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis** is changed to **Immunity to Sleep and Paralysis.** The Half-Elf cannot be put to sleep or paralyzed by spells or creature attacks. They can, however, be _petrified_ by such creatures as Basilisks or Medusas.
- **Sylvan Sense.** The Half-Elf can concentrate for one turn on a held item to determine its magical status by arcane means but cannot reveal its properties; only a Magic User, Illusionist, and sometimes a Cleric can do this.

### Half-Orc

- **Low-Light Vision:** The Half-Orc gains Low-Light Vision (see [Low-Light Vision](https://www.notion.so/Low-Light-Vision-47b310049e314f2bbbe5c4294fe904f3?pvs=21))
- The Half-Orc racial die is d6.
- **Grim Tenacity:** The Half-Orc's hardiness defies death. When reduced to 0 hp, the Half-Orc must succeed on a saving throw versus Death to remain conscious; on success, they may act until the end of the next round or until reduced to -10 hp. On failure, they drop and begin dying as normal.
- **Stubborn Vitality:** When Half-Orcs reduce their Constitution when they reach 0 hp or lower, they reduce by that amount minus one. On 5th and 9th level, the reduction increases by one.
- **Brutal Grapple:** The Half-Orc's unarmed attacks and unarmed combat techniques, such as grappling, deal 1d4 damage in addition to their other effects. However, the Half-Orc can choose not to deal this damage.

### Svirnefblin

- **Stone Camouflage:** When motionless against a stone surface underground, the Svirnefblin has a 4-in-6 chance to be completely unnoticed by creatures without infra-vision or tremorsense. This combines with their Blend into Stone ability for extraordinary stealth in their native environment.
- **Gem Sense:** The Svirnefblin can concentrate for one turn on a gem or precious stone to evaluate its approximate value and detect if it has been magically altered or is an illusion. The Svirnefblin can also sense the presence of gem veins within 30 feet, though this only confirms their presence and provides no information about their type, quantity, or value. This builds on their innate Stone Murmurs ability.
- **Sure-Footed:** The Svirnefblin takes half the damage from falling on a rocky or earthy surface. When a Svirnefblin starts falling, and there's a rock edge in reach, they may attempt to save vs. Breath attack and grab a rocky edge on success, avoiding a fall.

## Advanced Classes

The following table lists attribute requirements for each Advanced Class.

| Class       | Requirements    |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Acrobat     | DEX 13+, STR 9+ |
| Assassin    | DEX 13+, INT 9+ |
| Barbarian   | STR 13+, CON 9+ |
| Bard        | CHA 13+, DEX 9+ |
| Druid       | WIS 13+, CHA 9+ |
| Illusionist | INT 13+, DEX 9+ |
| Knight      | STR 13+, CHA 9+ |
| Paladin     | CHA 13+, WIS 9+ |
| Ranger      | STR 13+, WIS 9+ |

> Advanced classes get +5% XP advancement if their primary requirement is 16+, and an additional +5% XP advancement if their secondary requirement is 13+

### Acrobat

- Requirements: DEX 13+, STR 9+
- **Acrobat Skills** use a percentile system modeled on Thief skills.
  - At Level 1, the Acrobat begins with the following values: Climb Sheer Surfaces 40%, Falling 25%, Tightrope Walking 40%, Hide in Shadows 10%, and Move Silently 10%.
  - At Level 1 the Acrobat does not distribute increases. At gaining a new level, the Acrobat can distribute two additional increases. You may not put more than one increase in the same skill. Each increase adds +15% to a chosen skill.
  - Climb Sheer Surfaces and Tightrope Walking may reach 100%. Falling, Hide in Shadows, and Move Silently may reach 70%.
- Once per day, the Acrobat can reroll a failed saving throw versus Breath or versus Spells, Wands and Staves as long as they are unimpeded to move, and are not surprised by the effect.
- **Dodge Die:** Once per round, if an Acrobat is about to take damage from a successful attack, they roll a d4 and add the rolled result to their AC. If this causes the AC to become higher than the attack roll, the attack still hits but does only 1 hp of damage and no other effects, if any. The die size changes to d6 at the 5th level, d8 at the 9th level, and d10 at the 13th. The Acrobat does not benefit from Dodge die if they are prone, grappled, or their movement is impeded or slowed by external factors such as difficult terrain.
- **Tumbling Strike:** When the Acrobat attacks, they make an FA skill check before the attack roll, or they can announce a Charge to make a tumbling attack. On success on the FA check or using a Charge, the attack, if successful, does double damage, and if the opponent is unaware of the attack, the attack benefits from +4 to hit. On failure of the FA check, the attack, if successful, makes only 1 point of damage (no damage roll is made), and the Acrobat cannot use a tumbling attack until the end of the encounter.

### Assassin

- Requirements: DEX 13+, INT 9+
- **Assassination Scaling:** The damage dealt when the target of an assassination succeeds on its save against instant death is doubled on the 5th, tripled on the 9th, and quadrupled on the 13th level. For each level above 9th, the target's save against instant death check result is decreased by 1.
- **Skill Track (Thief conv.):** The Assassin refers to the Thief's custom rules for Climb, Hear Noises, and Move Silently. No change is made to Assassination skill.
  - The Assassin’s Climb skill matches the values of the Thief.
  - The Assassin starts with 2 increases at level 1. They get 1 increase on each level up.

### Barbarian

- Requirements: STR 13+, CON 9+
- **Skill Track (Wilderness):** Skills use a percentile system modeled on Thief skills.
  - At Level 1, start at: Climb 25%, Hide in Undergrowth 10%, Move Silently 10%.
  - No increases at 1st level. Levels 2–9: **+1 increase per level**. Levels 10–14: **+2 increases per level**. Each increase is **+15%** to a chosen skill. Only 1 increase per skill per level.
  - **Caps:** Climb 85%; Hide in Undergrowth 70%; Move Silently 70%.
  - Result: exactly 18 total increases by 14th level; full caps are only reachable at high level, not midgame.
- **Damage Reduction:** The Barbarian reduces all damage taken by non-magical attacks by 1. This reduction increases to 2 at the 9th level. The damage taken cannot be reduced below 1.
- **Battle Senses:** The Barbarian has sharpened all its senses in combat. When caught surprised, unaware, or blind-fighting, such as in pitch darkness, the benefit to hit enemies receive is reduced to +2 instead of +4. When surprised or in pitch darkness, the Barbarian can make a saving throw against Death to prevent damage against them from being doubled.
- **Charge Fury:** When the Barbarian charges, in addition to +2 to the attack roll, they also benefit from +2 plus their Strength bonus for the damage roll. The Barbarian can also charge again after they reduce an enemy to 0 hp.

### Bard

- Requirements: CHA 13+, DEX 9+
- **Bard Skills** reflect the Bard's subtlety and performance.
  - At Level 1, the Bard begins with Pick Pockets 10%, Move Silently 10%, Hide in Shadows 10%, and Hear Noise 1-in-6.
  - The Bard starts with 1 increase at 1st level. Starting with Level 2, the Bard gains 1 increase each level. Each increase adds +15% to a percentile skill or +1 to Hear Noise (max 5-in-6). Only 1 increase per skill per level.
  - Pick Pockets, Move Silently, and Hide in Shadows can reach 70%.
  - Hear Noise can reach 5-in-6.
- **Battle Songs:** When rolling initiative, a Bard may choose to forgo movement this round and sing, or forgo making an attack this round and play an instrument. If they sing during the round, allies benefit from +2 to Morale Checks. If they play an instrument during the round, enemies that can hear the music suffer -2 to their attack rolls unless they attack the Bard.
- **Stunning Flourish:** When the Bard charges and hits, they may choose to do 1 point of damage instead of rolling for damage. If they do, the target must save versus spell or be stunned, losing their next turn. Until they act again, attacks against the target benefit from +2 to hit.
- **Bardic Knowledge.** The Bard can concentrate for one turn on a subject, an object, or a person and has a 1-in-6 chance of knowing an obscure fact about them. There is an additional 2-in-6 chance that the fact will be helpful for the party and its goals, and on a roll of 6 on that secondary check, the fact is always wrong. The fact is never a direct solution or applicable hint to what actions the party must follow. Both checks are made by the DM, and the second roll is never revealed to the player. The first check improves to 2-in-6 at the 5th, 3-in-6 at the 9th, and 4-in-6 at the 13th level.

### Druid

- Requirements: WIS 13+, CHA 9+
- **Favored Terrain Vow:** The Druid has a favored terrain, the region's wilderness, which they have vowed to protect. With the blessing of their circle, a Druid may travel to discover new terrain in distress that they can vow to protect once they accomplish a deed to defend it.
- **Herbal Salves:** The Druid can make natural salves that stop bleeding and ease pain as long as they are within or have access to their favored terrain. The Druid can recover 1d3 hp to self or another living creature, and double the natural healing rate for the day. Each creature can benefit from this once per day.
- **Antivenom Craft:** The Druid can use survival skills and natural means to cure weaker poisons. The Druid has a 5-in-6 chance to cure poison. The chance is lowered by 1-in-6 for each level of poison above level I. A chance of 0-in-6 makes it impossible to attempt a roll.
- **Wild Bonds:** The Druid suffers -4 to Morale checks to recruit and maintain service of non-animal retainers and hirelings, but +2 to Morale checks to encounter and recruit animal companions. Druids can calm animals and beasts (including dire beasts) with a +2 bonus to the Morale Check. Druids can be uncooperative at times and have difficulty communicating with civilized folk, and civilized folk often have a negative bias towards them.
- **Animal Companion:** The Druid may start with an animal companion and recruit as many animals as possible up to their hireling limit. The animal companion should be native to their favored terrain, be treated as a henchman, and count against the limit. They should not make Morale checks (or use a Morale value of 10 if needed) or require anything beyond care and companionship. Each animal may have HD no higher than a third of the Druid's HD, rounded up. If lost, a replacement animal companion can be found within 1d4 weeks per HD of the lost companion, provided the search occurs in the Druid's favored terrain. The DM decides the number of HDs of the companion using bestiary entries rather than the theoretical maximum allowed by these rules. If the Druid gains levels that change their companion’s Hit Dice limit, the animal companions grow in experience along them, with additional Hit Die added to their stats.

### Illusionist

- Requirements: INT 13+, DEX 9+
- **Minor Conjurations:** The Illusionist can spend one hour conjuring an illusion of a small object or tiny creature that appears natural at a cursory glance. The Illusionist must be intimately familiar with a real object or creature to create an illusion of it. It has a 3-in-6 chance to behave as expected, a 2-in-6 chance to feel genuine to touch, and a 1-in-6 chance to emit sound or smell that resembles the real thing; these are rolled when the illusion is created. As long as the illusion appears natural, any other creature needs to interact with the illusion (usually by touching it) and make a simple Wisdom check to disbelieve it for themselves. The illusion cannot deal damage or interact with other creatures that are not illusions; it is destroyed if any damage is dealt. The illusion appears as a magical effect to spells that detect magic. All illusions disappear when their creator loses consciousness (such as sleeping or being knocked out). The number of minor illusions an Illusionist can maintain at once is 2 plus their Intelligence modifier.
- **Illusion Savvy:** Illusionists do not need to interact with an illusion; if they can see it, they can make a simple Wisdom check to disbelieve it for themselves (others are still subject to believe in it).
- **Arcane/Illusion Sense:** The Illusionist can concentrate on a held item for one turn to determine if it is magical by arcane means and its properties. Cursed items never reveal their curse until they are appropriately used. The Illusionist can also focus on an item or area of up to 30 feet and sense if it is an illusionary object or location as long as the level of the illusion spell used to cast the illusion (or the maximum spell level available to its caster if not via a spell but a ritual or other grand magic of permanence) is equal or lower than the maximum spell level available to the Illusionist. For example, a 5th-level Illusionist can see through illusions cast by a slot up to the 3rd level and ritual illusions of other magic users and Illusionists of the 6th level and below.

### Knight

- Requirements: STR 13+, CHA 9+
- **Noble Standing:** The Knight's social status cannot be lower than a landless Noble. If the player rolls for social status and does not like the result, they can become a landless Noble instead. The Knight also has a claim to an inheritance that the DM may interweave in their personal campaign goals; if the inheritance is claimed, the 9th-level keep becomes immediately available at the current level.
- **Retinue:** The Knight can take two extra hirelings, and an additional one at 5th and 9th level. The Knight benefits from +2 to attract retainers and hirelings, +2 to interview them, and +1 to recognize their capabilities and statistics.
- **Shield Stand:** The Knight can announce a shield stand before rolling initiative each round; it precludes movement this turn. The Knight's benefit from using a shield and all adjacent allies wielding a shield increases from +1 to +2 to AC and +1 to Parry attack rolls until the start of the next turn.
- **Battle Oath:** Once per encounter, the Knight can speak a passionate oath of the moment before they roll initiative on a round of their choice. This oath may taunt opponents of opposite alignment to focus their attacks on the Knight. Until the Knight remains standing, all hirelings have +2 to their Morale Checks.

### Paladin

- Requirements: CHA 13+, WIS 9+, must be of Lawful alignment
- **Donation Zeal:** The Paladin gains one and a half times the XP reward for donated gold and treasure. While 10% is the required minimum by their church, there is no maximum amount the Paladin can donate.
- **Dedication to Law & Good.** The Paladin has a +1 to attack rolls against inherently evil creatures with hit dice equal to or greater than theirs. They also deal +2 extra damage when they hit an inherently evil creature with hit dice less than theirs.
- **Smite Evil:** At 5th level, when the Paladin rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll against an inherently evil creature, the attack deals maximum damage plus an extra damage roll. At 9th level, the Paladin smites on a natural 19, and at 14th level, the Paladin smites on a natural 18.
- **Divert the Wicked:** The Paladin can taunt evil creatures able to reach and attack the Paladin within their next turn to draw their attention away from non-Paladin allies. High-intelligence evil creatures require a properly worded taunt to draw them to attack the Paladin against their interests.
- **Sanctified Sense:** The Paladin can spend a turn concentrating to detect the presence of evil enchantments and creatures of evil alignment within 60'. Unlike the detect evil spell, this does not cause them to glow; it only gives the Paladin a confirmation of nearby presence. The Paladin can also hold an item or an intelligent weapon and sense if it is inherently evil or tainted by a greater evil.
- **Clean of Body:** The Paladin is immune to common diseases. A common disease is a non-magical disease with a known cure or a chance of survival without a cure. The Paladin has a 2-in-6 chance to cure simple diseases and a 1-in-6 chance to cure simple virulent diseases with a lay of hand; the cured patient recovers in 3d6 days.

### Ranger

- Requirements: STR 13+, WIS 9+
- **Favored Terrain:** The Ranger has a favored terrain, the wilderness of the region where they have been born or have lived most of their lives. The chosen favored terrain cannot be changed. They have trained all their life to protect the wilderness against two groups of common enemies: in temperate woods, these are goblinoids and orcs. The DM may change one or both of these groups if the common enemies of other terrains differ.
- **Common Enemies:** Two enemy groups tied to the favored terrain (e.g., goblinoids, orcs in temperate woods).
- **Terrain Skills** are tied to the Ranger's favored terrain.
  - At Level 1, the Ranger begins with Hear Noise 1-in-6, Hide in Shadows 10%, and Move Silently 10%.
  - The Ranger starts with no increases at level 1. Starting with level 2, the Ranger gains 1 increase each level. Each increase adds +15% to a percentile skill or +1 to Hear Noise (max 5-in-6). Only 1 increase per skill per level.
  - Hide in Shadows and Move Silently can reach 70%.
  - These skills function only in the Ranger’s favored terrain.
- **No Tithes:** The Ranger's requirement to donate has been removed. The only class required to donate is the Paladin, and they have additional benefits from that.
- **Fleet in Terrain:** The Ranger's walking speed in their favored terrain increases by 10 feet when not impeded by armor, rugged terrain, or other circumstances.
- **Enemy Slayer:** The Ranger has vowed an enmity against all races threatening their favored terrain, usually the woods. The Ranger may perform an assassination (similar to the Assassin class) against their common enemies, gaining +4 to attack rolls and dealing double damage if the enemies are unaware. They also have +1 to the damage rolls against their common enemies (does not stack with weapon specialization).
- **Vigilant Guide:** The Ranger is always vigilant in their favored terrain, and when not distracted by any other tasks, they lower the party surprise chance, usually 2-in-6, to 1-in-6. If the Ranger spends an hour to create a hideout in their favored terrain, they can increase the enemy surprise chance, usually 2-in-6, to 3-in-6.
- **Rough Company:** Due to their uncouth nature, the Ranger suffers -2 to Morale checks when recruiting and maintaining service for non-animal retainers, and humanoid hirelings who do not live in or near their favored terrain. They have +2 to Morale checks when encountering animals and beasts (but not dire beasts, those only the Druid can calm) common to their favored terrain.

## Appendix 1 - Magic Senses

This table simplifies the different inherent magic senses that spellcasting classes have. Unless noted otherwise, each Magic Sense requires 1 turn (10 minutes of exploration) to use properly.

| Class       | Held Item                                                                                         | Area, 30’ by default                                        | Cursed Items      | Intelligent Items           | Illusions equal or below the caster level |

> 🪄 **Practical Identification:** Anyone with a practice of use (typically about a turn long) can identify magical weapons and armor with enchantment bonuses to attack, damage, or AC. Still, a magic user or an illusionist must recognize any other qualities of the magical item (such as passive or triggered abilities or additional damage) before they can be used.

## Combat

### Draw/Stow Weapon

If a character is not holding the weapon he wants to use, he can drop what is in his hands and draw a weapon (assuming the weapon is in an accessible place, such as on a belt sheath). There's a -2 penalty to hit during the round that this happens. If a two-handed weapon is drawn, or two one-handed weapons, a one-handed weapon and a shield are drawn, the penalty increases to -4.

### Attacking Surprised Enemies

You can strike any surprised or unaware of threat enemy with a bonus of +2 to a melee or ranged attack (only rogues and assassin get a multiplier to their damage). You also benefit from this bonus if you attack an enemy engaged in combat and unaware of your presence, unable to perceive you or your approximate location.

> **MOVEMENT FROM STEALTH** Unless you end your turn in a location providing a cover, you are detected by all enemies able to perceive you with one or several of their senses. When you move out of cover your turn, you do not become detected to any surprised or unaware enemies that share the same initiative value as you, until you take an action, make an attack, or your turn ends.

### Running in Combat

You may announce that your character will run in combat before initiative is rolled each turn. Running in combat allows your character to use its exploration speed for movement instead of its combat speed. The character cannot do anything else this turn and suffers a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks until the start of their next turn. The character may not run at its exploration speed through any terrain that would impede or slow down its movement.

### Subduing Damage

Attacks with the "flat of the blade" for non-lethal damage are made at a -1 attack penalty. No penalty is applied if the melee weapon does bludgeoning damage and its damage die is not larger than d6. Attacks with ranged weapons that aim to disable the enemy by striking non-lethally are made at a -2 attack penalty and cannot be made at a long-range distance. Spells cannot do nonlethal damage.

### Shooting Attacks Past Creatures

When you shoot with a ranged weapon, and your line of attack passes through allies, or your target is already engaged with one or several allies, you risk hitting your allies on a poorly aimed shot. When you roll a very low natural result (1, 2, 3, etc.), your attack hits the first, second, third, etc., ally in order of closest to furthest from you instead of its intended target or randomly if they are all engaged with your initial target. Shooting through hostile creatures to hit one beyond them applies a -1 penalty to attack, plus -1 for each hostile creature that must not be hit to reach your target.

### Defensive Stance, Parry

During your attack phase, you may choose not to attack this round. If you do so, until the start of your next turn, you may prepare to Parry one melee attack that targets you by an enemy you see during your turn.

When an enemy rolls to attack and hits you before damage is rolled, you may Parry if you had prepared to. Make a roll to attack and compare your result with the result of your enemy. If your result is equal or higher, you successfully parry the attack and take no damage from it. If your Parry beat the enemy's attack roll by three or more, you get an opportunity to riposte, and the enemy takes d4 damage (with no modifiers) from your weapon.

### Cover an Ally

While you share the same 5-foot square space as another ally and the ally is prone on the ground by or behind you, you can cover that ally from enemy attacks. At the end of your turn, you take a -1 penalty to your ascending Armor Class (or +1 if descending), and your ally benefits from +2 to their ascending Armor Class (or -2 if not ascending). This effect lasts until the end of your next turn when you can continue or end this effect. Low-intelligence enemies would attack you instead of the ally you cover; high-intelligence enemies may choose to attack through you.

While prone and sharing the same 5-foot square space, your ally chooses to take no movement and no attack action but to improve its cover from you. This must be announced before rolling the initiative for the round. If they do so, the benefit from being covered by you increases to +4 to their ascending Armor Class (or -4 if not ascending).

## Masterwork Weapons and Armor

Finely crafted weapons and armor (denoted +1 masterwork in statblocks) are often just superior items of expert workmanship, often status symbols for nobility, knights, and officials. These are not magical unless they exhibit additional magical effects (e.g., glow under detect magic, special abilities). True magical weapons/armor (+1 or higher) add their full bonus to both to-hit and damage/AC.

| Item Type               | Benefit                     | Durability                 | Cost Mod        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Weapon (Masterwork)** | +1 to hit **only**          | +1 SV vs. sunder/rust/acid | ×3              |
| **Armor (Masterwork)**  | +1 AC **only**              | —                          | ×5              |
| **Weapon (Magical +X)** | +X to hit **and** +X damage | +1 SV vs. sunder/rust/acid | Per magic rules |
| **Armor (Magical +X)**  | +X AC                       | +X SV vs. sunder/rust/acid | Per magic rules |

## Damage and Healing

### Dropping to 0

- When you take damage and your hp becomes 0 or less, you drop unconscious and start dying, and the excess damage is deducted from your Constitution score, point for point. Record your modified Constitution score separately, but do not change your hit points modifier yet.

> 🎲 **Foundry Tip:** In Foundry, create a character ability in your character sheet and use its name to record your unmodified Constitution so you are quickly reminded of its maximum value later on.

- When your Constitution score is reduced as a result of taking damage and your hit points are 0, anytime you receive first aid, magical healing or healing potion, or natural healing (such as a salve), make a d20-roll-under Constitution check. If you make the save, you were still hanging on your dear life even if your hit points are 0, and the healing effect is applied. If you fail the save, you died before you could have been healed and are pronounced dead.
- Once combat is over, within one minute of starting dying any player character that is unconscious and starts receiving first aid lasting at least one turn makes the same Constitution save, and on success recovers 1 hp at the end of the turn receiving first aid. Retainers and henchmen have a 2-in-6 chance to regain 1 hp if they receive first aid, and the chance is modified by their Constitution bonus to hit points (minimum 0 in 6, maximum 5-in-6). Any other creature left without first aid will die.
- At the end of combat, recalculate your hit points using your changed Constitution score. If your modified Constitution score is 7 or below, the negative modifier to hit dice is also applied as a penalty to attack rolls and all saving throws. This doesn’t happen mid-combat but only after combat, when the adrenaline wears off.
- Also at the end of combat, you gain an injury that is for roleplaying purposes only and will remind you of the unfortunate events of this combat. Work with your DM on the specifics of the injury. If you lost 3 or fewer Constitution points this combat, the injury is minor and will fully heal once your Constitution score returns to normal. If you lost 4 or more Constitution points in this combat, the injury is severe and will never fully heal, although once your Constitution score returns to normal you will learn how to deal with it for the rest of your life.
- If your Constitution score reaches 0, you are decapitated. Spells that would prevent death or bring you back to life (or unlife, unless it doesn’t require a capable body) consider your body unusable.
- You recover 1 point of Constitution per week if your modified Constitution is 7 or less, and 1d3 points of Constitution per week if your modified Constitution is 8 or more. If you do not benefit from medical care, you do not recover anything if your Constitution is 7 or less, or 1 point if your Constitution is 8 or more. Your modified Constitution cannot increase above your normal Constitution.

### Fire Damage

Burning Oil Flasks do 1 point of damage when they break after a successful hit and set a creature on fire. At the start of its turn, a burning creature takes 1d6 points of fire damage. If the damage taken from that die is 1-3, the die rolled on the next turn decreases in size (to 1d4, and if 1d4 decreases in size the creature is no longer Burning). The Burning creature can also choose to not attack on its turn but attempt to stop the burning; it drops what it is carrying or must drop prone, and this causes the die rolled on the next turn to decrease in size. Using multiple oil flasks to put a creature on fire has no cumulative effect on the creature's burning condition but each following flask resets the die size to d6.

Improved or Magical Burning Oil can start for a die higher than d6 and take more turns to stop, or have fewer or specific conditions to decrease its die size.

### Bleeding Damage

Weapons with the Bleeding quality cause the Bleeding condition on a critical roll of natural 20 on attack rolls, and when they roll maximum damage. A Bleeding creature takes 1 damage at the end of their turn and makes a Constitution check; on success, they stop Bleeding.

## Skills

### Chapter 5: Skills (Rules Cyclopaedia, pg. 81-86)

Check Rules Cyclopaedia, pg. 81-86, for description of Skills.

### Beginning Skills (Rules Cyclopaedia, pg. 81)

Players do not select their skills for character creation. Instead, they receive blank slots that they can fill in anytime before making a skill or attribute check requested by the DM.

Anytime the DM asks for a specific skill check, you may announce that your character has always had this skill and spend a blank slot to get the skill before making a check. The DM may ask you to explain how your character attained this skill, and your reasoning expands on your character's backstory.

### Skill Use

The DM chooses the difficulty of each skill check and announces it to the players. Most checks are Simple (easy to moderate) or Expert (challenging and demanding). Heroic Checks are only required against challenges that can only be attempted by characters of a specific class (such as Thief and Acrobat).

- **Simple Checks:** Characters who do not have the applicable skill make an ability check; a success on that check is always a partial success with minor complications or limited results, such as taking more time or shoddy work. Characters who have an applicable skill succeed without making a check and with success with no imperfections and complications. Characters with class skills succeed without making a check.
- **Expert Checks**: Characters who do not have the applicable skill cannot usually attempt the check, though the DM may allow a check at -5 to the ability score if the skill is something that does not require specialized training. Characters who have applicable skills make an ability check. Characters with a class skill succeed without making a check.
- **Heroic Checks**: Characters cannot make the check, even if they have an applicable skill. Only classes with an appropriate class skill can attempt an X-in-6 or percentile check as described in their skill.

Remember, only one check can be made in a situation as it applies to the situation, not a particular player’s ability to achieve the result (see Using Skills Together, pg. 86). If multiple players are acting together, such as trying to listen through a door, the ones who would succeed with the rolled result achieve the success.

### Clarified Skills

- **Deception (pg. 83)** — The Deception skill cannot be used without roleplaying a plausible lie. Success in the skill only internalizes a good lie and may provide the push to motivate the target to act upon your life.
- **Detect Deception (pg. 83)** — The Detect Deception skill cannot be used without the player explicitly stating what the player (not their character!) believes is the truth. A successful skill check allows the DM to confirm or refute that statement. This is intended to give a vague confirmation but not skip social roleplaying or discussions between players. Heroic success, however, may reveal the deceptive intentions of your examination's target.
- **Healing (pg. 83)** — You cannot heal a creature a second time unless a day has passed since your last Healing, or it has received 4 or more hit points damage in another combat encounter.
- **Stealth (pg. 85)** — This skill is only needed when needing to move silently or pass by enemies within sensory range with limited time to prepare; no skill is required to hide in a stationary way or with ample time to prepare. Most Stealth checks to move silently within enemy sensory range are typically Expert checks. Still, the legendary heists known from heroic fantasy are Heroic checks and only Thief's territory. Extraordinary success on a Stealth check, or success on a Move Silently check by a Thief, allows one to cover up for the failure or inability to attempt the check of one other party character.

### Improving Skills (pg. 86)

- You cannot spend slots to take the same skill twice until level 5 unless the skill has a different subject or area of competence, as listed in the skill description.
- On reaching level 5, you may take the same skill a second time to become an Expert. On reaching level 9, you may take the same skill a third time to become a Master.
- When taking the same skill a second time, your character becomes an Expert, and the expertise bonus is +2 instead of the listed +1. When taking the same skill a third time and your character becomes a Master, the expertise bonus is +5 instead of the implied +2.
- Rolling 1 on the d20 die results in Exceptional success. Exceptional results may give you more information, take much less time to achieve, or create masterpieces of craftsmanship.
- Becoming an Expert improves your chance of achieving exceptional results. On a natural d20 roll of 1, or if your d20 result is 10 points or more below your attribute plus your +3 expertise bonus, your result is exceptional. _For example, a character with an Intelligence of 15 is an Expert in Science (geology); they succeed on 18 or less, and if they roll 8 or less, they get exceptional success._
- Becoming a Master makes almost all your successes exceptional. Your result is an exceptional success if your d20 result equals or below your unmodified attribute score (without applying the +5 expertise bonus). _For example, a character with an Intelligence of 15 is a Master in Science (geology); they succeed on 19 or less (20 is always a failure), and if they roll 15 or less, they get an exceptional success._

> 👉🏼 **NPC Expertise Guidance:** Adventurers may rarely consider becoming an Expert or a Master worthy of focusing their limited skill slots on the same skill. However, these rules apply to NPCs that players may seek for their services. As a rule of thumb, Specialists are at least Experts in their field.

### Retraining Skills (New)

- Between adventures, you may spend 50 gp per character level and one month and turn one skill into a blank slot, ready to be filled during their next adventures. If you are an Expert or Master, the cost is increased to 100 gp and 150 gp per character level, and you receive back two or three slots, respectively. This assumes that your character has spent the time and money to train for an undisclosed skill that will be revealed at the appropriate moment during adventuring.

## Hirelings

### Changes to Hirelings

Retainers, also called Normal Men in Rules Cyclopedia, do not earn XP and are not entitled to a share of the treasure found unless such is negotiated. Retainers that are not paid extra or a tiny share usually have a -2 penalty to their Morale Checks.

Mercenaries, also called hirelings, have no limitation to their use. They can be brought to dungeons to adventure by the player’s side. They are paid a salary, entitled to a half share of treasure found, and gain experience (but separately from the players). If not paid in time for multiple consecutive weeks, mercenaries tend to degrade their Morale by up to -1 cumulative penalty for each significant reason of discord and are likely to revolt or disband when it reaches -4 or worse.

### Hireling Experience

When the party gains experience by killing monsters, the earned experience points are divided among the players and each player earns their share. Hirelings also earn experience points but not from the same pool as players. They use their own separate pool that is equal to the experience earned but divided among the sum of all players and all the hirelings, and the hirelings receive their share from that pool. This is usually a smaller share of experience than those player characters get.

When the party gains gold and experience by dividing and selling treasure, hirelings are entitled to a half share. In this case, players and hirelings divide the same pool, and the more hirelings are included in the pool the less players are going to earn.

*Example: Five adventurers bring six hirelings. When a monster worth 1000 xp is killed, each adventurer earns 1000 / 5 = 200 xp. Each hireling earns 1000 / (5 + 6 = 11) = 91 xp. The monster’s treasure is worth 900 gp. The party divides treasure between players and hirelings; players take two shares each, and hirelings take one share each (900 / (5*2) + 6 = 56 gp 26 cp each). Each player takes 112.5 gp, while each hireling takes 56.26 gp.\*

### Hireling Limit

The Charisma-based limit of the number of hired men applies to retainers (called Normal Men in Rules Cyclopedia) and hirelings (or mercenaries in Old School Essentials). Separately, each player has a hireling limit equal to 2 plus their Charisma bonus. The Knight is an exception to this rule and can hire 4 plus their Charisma bonus.

_Example: a typical adventurer with Charisma of 11 (+0) can hire 4 retainers, or 2 retainers and 2 hirelings._

### Retainers (Normal Men)

All non-combatant adults have THAC0 of 19 (+0 to hit), Saving Throw of 16, and 1d4 hit points from their racial die. Small children and young women have no combat proficiencies (thus having -4 to hit), a Saving Throw of 18, and only 1 hit point (1d2 for women).

### Level 0 Hirelings

Many hirelings in the game will be Level 0 hirelings with limited real-world combat experience. A level 0 Hireling has all the features of their class but rolls their first HD instead of taking its maximum value, as adventurers and other level 1 class hirelings do. They must reroll if they roll the maximum value of the hit die, typically having below the average hp for the first level of their class.

An L0 hireling becomes an L1 hireling when it acquires 100 XP. When it gains its first level, a hireling changes its first hit die to its maximum value instead of the previously rolled value.

_Example: Harold, an L0 Fighter, rolled their racial die for 1, and first HD and got 2, so they have 3 HP. When Harold gains 100 XP and reaches L1, Harold's first HD becomes its maximum (d8), giving them 9 HP._

## Environment

### Darkness

Attacking a creature you cannot see imposes penalties based on lighting conditions and available sensory information:

**Blinded, or Pitch Darkness (no light source):** -4 to attack rolls, and all complex interactions require a check at -4 darkness penalty. Creatures rely entirely on sound, air flow and smell, and touch to locate targets. Assassins and Thieves may use pitch darkness as a substitute for surprise, as long as their exact location cannot be pinpointed by their target by other senses like sound or smell, and they succeed on Move Silent check rolled before any movement or action. Creatures with infravision ignore these penalties in pitch darkness but suffer the standard penalties if any light source is present within their range.

**Moonlit Darkness or Dim Light (edges of torchlight):** -2 to attack rolls. Creatures can perceive vague shapes and movement but lack detail for precise strikes. This applies at the edge of a torch's 30' radius or in open moonlight with partial concealment. Creatures with low-light vision ignore these penalties in moonlit darkness and dim light.

**Other Senses:** A character with exceptional sense of smell (such as animal companions) or hearing (character with Hear Noise 4-in-6 or better) reduce darkness penalties by 1 for each exceptional sense.

### Torches

The following torches are available for sale in most villages:

**Standard Torch (1 sp, 1 cn):** Pitch-coated wood bundle. Burns 1d4+4 turns (5–8 turns), produces 30' light radius. Produces smell of tar and smoke, will sputter in rain and wind environments, with a risk of 2-in-6 to extinguish in extreme gust or heavy rain.

**Birch-Bark Torch (2 sp, 1 cn):** Dried birch bark roll. Burns 1d6+5 turns (6–11 turns), produces 40' light radius. Burns cleaner with minimal smoke; performs better in gusts and damp conditions (upgrades chance to extinguish to 1-in-6).

**Pine-Resin Torch (4 sp, 2 cn):** Resin-packed wooden core. Burns 2d4+6 turns (8–14 turns), produces 50' light radius. Produces heavy smoke and pungent aroma, both which can be traced to use of torches in a closed air environment. Extremely flammable; cannot be easily extinguished. Reserved for extended and military expeditions. The lingering smell makes them a liability during stealth missions.

The DM rolls this duration privately and tracks the countdown without revealing it to the party. When a torch has 2 turns remaining, the DM announces: "Your torch is guttering. The flame flickers and weakens." When the turn count expires, the torch extinguishes and complete darkness descends unless another light source is lit.

A character holding a torch occupies one hand with it. Torches mounted in wall sconces or affixed to gear do not occupy a hand but cannot be moved. A character may deliberately extinguish a torch to conserve it. Relighting a torch requires flint and steel and takes 1 minute; lighting a torch in pitch darkness is a Dexterity check at standard -4 darkness penalty. Spells or magical effects relight torches instantly.

A typical adventurer carries 3–6 torches at any time. Hiring a Torchbearer (1 sp/day, retainer) preserves hand economy and ensures backup light. Multiple party members carrying torches provide redundancy in case one is lost or extinguished.

### Infravision (a.k.a. Old-School Darkvision)

Infravision only works in pitch darkness. If a creature with infravision is within range of a light source, the infravision is disabled until the creature is no longer within the range of a light source and not facing any light source.

Infravision only detects blotches of heat without any actual form, and rough silhouettes of environments where heat is present. They cannot read or notice fine details with infravision, such as recognizing monsters except by size, silhouette (differentiating two and four-legged form, or the difference between an orc and a goblin), and behavior (how they move). They cannot recognize any fine detail or visual properties such as color of individual objects.

### Low Light Vision

Creatures with infravision also have low-light vision. Creatures with low light vision see twice as far in torchlight, up to 60 feet rather than 30 feet.

### Moonlit Vision

In an open exterior where moonlight is present, if the moon cycle matches half-moon, three-quarters or full moon, the environment is considered dim light unless there is concealment (medium to thick woods, buildings casting shadows, etc.). In moonlit darkness, everyone gains Low Light Vision after 2 turns of scotopic adaptation, while creatures with low light vision see as if it were normal light (with caveats). Exposure to a bright source of light for 1 turn resets the scotopic adaptation in creatures without low light vision.

## Level Up

### XP and Economy

This adventure uses an x10 faster leveling speed than old-school D&D to allow for several level-ups during a single adventure and the ability to progress into later tiers of the game within modern day time constraints. The following changes apply:

- Characters earn 1xp for each 1sp (not 1gp!) of treasure secured during adventuring. Although the world economy and other factors may prevent them from converting all treasure into its nominal gold price, they will earn XP based on its nominal price.

### After Level 9

Upon gaining a new level past level 9, you may reroll your hit dice (typically limited to 9) and apply the new value to your maximum hit points if it is higher than your previous rolled value.

## Downtimes

### Life Time

- Each day of life outside of adventuring since the start of the adventuring career earns 1 XP. This includes a bit of training, occasional altercations, hardships, and events that happen to the character and their family. This experience is usually a reward for the player for surviving the adventure, based on the time between the previous and the next adventure; or a little bit of progress if the DM needs to move the timeline in the future but the character has not leveled up at all meanwhile.
- For every three levels of experience earned by the character, the gain of experience from such life events increases by 1 XP per day.

### Learn New Spells

Any class that can learn and cast spells gains XP when they learn a new spell they did not know already from sources such as discovered scrolls and spell books found while adventuring; spells received from other players do not provide XP. The XP earned is based on the type of spell learned:

- Common spells from the Old School Essentials Player's Tome provide XP equal to the spell's level multiplied by 50.
- Rare and unique spells from other sources, such as published supplements or created by the DM for the adventure, provide XP equal to the spell's level multiplied by 150, or more if the DM deems the spell extremely powerful or rare.

### Philanthropy

While residing in a civilized settlement, a PC may donate gold to philanthropic causes to gain experience points and social standing. Characters receive XP equal to 80% of gold donated. Donations can be made as frequently as desired—donate 10 gp today, 50 gp next week, 200 gp before leaving town. Track cumulative donations for social consequence purposes.

**Philanthropic Acts:** Donations can take many forms—funding temple reconstruction, sponsoring orphanages, providing grain during famine, financing public works, patronizing the arts, or supporting local militias. The DM may adjust consequences based on the nature and appropriateness of the donation.

**Social Consequences:** Once your cumulative donations to a settlement reach a threshold, roll 2d6 and consult the table below. Add +1 if donations align with your character's stated values or class purpose (e.g., Clerics donating to temples, Paladins funding the poor). Add +1 for the Generous threshold or +2 for the Legendary threshold.

#### Social Thresholds

| **Settlement Size** | **Modest (2d6)** | **Notable (2d6)** | **Generous (2d6+1)** | **Legendary (2d6+2)** |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Village             | 100 gp           | 300 gp            | 600 gp               | 1000 gp               |
| Town                | 200 gp           | 500 gp            | 1000 gp              | 2000 gp               |
| City                | 400 gp           | 1000 gp           | 2000 gp              | 4000 gp               |
| Metropolis          | 800 gp           | 2000 gp           | 4000 gp              | 8000 gp               |

When you cross a threshold for the first time, roll 2d6 once on the consequences table below (applying threshold and alignment bonuses). The result is permanent for this settlement. You only roll once per threshold—crossing Modest gives one roll, crossing Notable later gives another roll, etc. The Legendary threshold can be repeated—every time you donate an additional threshold amount (1000 gp in a village, 2000 gp in a town, etc.), you may roll again on the consequence table.

#### Philanthropic Consequences (2d6)

| **Roll** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2        | **Outrage:** The locals see your donation as an insult or bribe. -2 to Reaction rolls in this settlement. You may not benefit from philanthropy here again until you complete a dangerous quest that directly aids the community. Local authorities become suspicious.                      |
| 3        | **Resentment:** Your wealth is seen as ill-gotten or your charity condescending. -1 to Reaction rolls in this settlement. You cannot gain XP from philanthropy here until you perform meaningful community service (DM's discretion).                                                       |
| 4        | **Mistrust:** People question where your gold came from. -1 to Reaction rolls with merchants and guards. Rumors spread about your past.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5        | **Skepticism:** The donation is accepted but your motives are doubted. No mechanical effect, but NPCs remain wary. Future Reaction rolls in edge cases may suffer -1.                                                                                                                       |
| 6        | **Noted:** Your donation is recorded without fanfare. No mechanical benefit. The settlement's record-keepers know your name.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 7        | **Appreciated:** The populace thanks you politely. No mechanical benefit, but the DM may grant +1 to specific Reaction rolls directly related to your donation (e.g., speaking to orphans you funded).                                                                                      |
| 8        | **Recognized:** Your name is remembered fondly. +1 to Reaction rolls in contexts related to your charitable cause. One NPC of modest means (laborer, shopkeeper, craftsman) becomes friendly.                                                                                               |
| 9        | **Respected:** Your generosity earns genuine goodwill. +1 to Reaction rolls in this settlement. One local NPC of modest means becomes a reliable contact willing to provide favors and information.                                                                                         |
| 10       | **Esteemed:** You're seen as a true benefactor. +1 to Reaction rolls in this settlement. One influential NPC (merchant, guild master, priest) becomes an ally willing to provide aid.                                                                                                       |
| 11       | **Celebrated:** Word spreads of your generosity. +1 to Reaction rolls in this settlement and +1 when first meeting NPCs within 15 miles who've heard of you. One influential NPC (merchant, guild master, priest) becomes an ally willing to provide significant aid.                       |
| 12       | **Legendary Patron:** Your deed becomes local legend. +2 to Reaction rolls in this settlement, +1 within 30 miles. Common goods and services cost 10% less. One powerful NPC (noble, high priest, archmage) becomes a devoted ally. Future philanthropy here gains +1 to consequence rolls. |

**Alignment Considerations:** Lawful characters gain an additional +1 to the consequence roll when donating to established institutions (temples, guilds, governments). Chaotic characters gain +1 when their donation disrupts the status quo or aids the downtrodden directly.

**Limits:** Track cumulative donations per settlement. Thresholds are permanent—once you've rolled for a threshold, you can't roll again for that threshold in this settlement. Negative consequences can be overcome through direct community service as determined by the DM.

### Carousing

While residing in a settlement, a PC may spend gold on feasting, drinking, and socializing to build personal relationships and gather information. Carousing does not grant XP—you're buying experiences and connections, not training. Specify how much you spend and where you carouse, then roll 2d6 on the table below.

**Venue and Spending:** Choose a venue and roll for the cost. If you don't have enough gold to cover the roll, you run a tab—you owe the difference and must repay it before you can carouse at this venue again. The DM determines available venues based on settlement size and character social standing.

| **Venue**        | **Cost Roll** | **Who You Meet and What you Get**                  |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Common Alehouse  | 1d8+1 gp      | Laborers, farmers, local gossip                    |
| Soldier's Tavern | 2d8+8 gp      | Mercenaries, guards, war veterans                  |
| Criminal Den     | 2d10+5 gp     | Thieves, smugglers, black market contacts          |
| Brothel          | 3d8+10 gp     | Courtesans, spies, scandalous secrets              |
| Guild Hall       | 5d10+20 gp    | Craftsmen, merchants, trade secrets                |
| Gambling Haven   | 5d12+25 gp    | High-stakes players, crime bosses, dangerous debts |
| Noble Court      | 10d10+50 gp   | Knights, nobles, political intrigue                |

**Bonus Spending:** After rolling the venue cost, you may voluntarily spend additional gold. Add +1 to the carousing outcome roll for every 50 gp spent beyond the rolled cost (maximum +3 bonus).

#### Carousing Outcomes (2d6)

| **Roll** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

You owe significant restitution or face criminal charges. You cannot carouse here for one month. **Roll on Complications table.**              |
| 3        | **Scandal:** Your behavior became the talk of the town for all the wrong reasons. -1 to Reaction rolls with this venue's entire social circle.

| 5        | **Awkward:** You made a poor impression but avoided disaster. No mechanical effect, but one NPC remembers you unfavorably. The DM may impose -1 to future Reaction rolls with that specific NPC.                                                                                                 |

| 7        | **Pleasant:** You enjoyed yourself and made no enemies. No mechanical benefit, but the DM may grant +1 to Reaction rolls if you return to this venue.                                                                                                                                            |

| 9        | **Memorable Evening:** You stood out in a good way. +1 to Reaction rolls with several NPCs present. You learn one valuable piece of information directly relevant to your current goals.                                                                                                         |
| 10       | **Valued Contact:** You befriended someone willing to provide favors. Gain a reliable contact who can offer services, information, or minor material aid when called upon. **Roll on Opportunities table.**                                                                                      |

**Faction Alignment:** Carousing with one group may alienate another. Drinking with the city watch makes thieves wary. Feasting with one noble house insults their rivals. The DM decides when carousing creates factional consequences.

**Maintaining Contacts:** Relationships from carousing fade without upkeep. If you haven't caroused with a contact in three months of game time, the DM may reduce their loyalty or willingness to help. Philanthropy builds monuments; carousing builds friendships that require maintenance.
