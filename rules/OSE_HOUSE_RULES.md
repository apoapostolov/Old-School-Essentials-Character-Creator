For each class, combine the write-up in the **Old School Essentials Advanced Player's Tome** with the changes and additions listed here.

## THAC0 / ToHit progression

Attack roll use the formula: **d20 + Attack Bonus + STR (melee) or DEX (ranged) modifirt ≥ target’s Ascending AC**. These progressions **replace all class THAC0 tables**. They smooth original B/X advances into gradual +1 steps (never more than +1 per level), matching exact final bonuses at traditional caps. Demi-human classes plateau after their max levels but retain the bonus beyond.
