# Cultural Gazetteer of Karameikos

## Anachronisms & Tone

- **The Cultural Mosaic:** Karameikos remains a dichotomy of Slavic fantasy infused with classic D&D-isms (goblins, orcs, etc.) and Western-medieval titles of feudal governance (Lords, Knights, Castellans, and Bailiffs). Retconning every title for tonal strictness is too heavy a burden; while the local populace has their own words for these stations, we accept these titles as impositions of the "Byzantine" Empire of Thyatis.
- **The Name "Traladara":** To the native ear, "Traladara" lacks gravitas. As Game Master, refer to it sparingly. It is understood to mean the "Gift of Speech" (Dar-Rech) or the common Slavic tongue. Legends of the ancient folk and the Song of King Halav refer to an ancestral kingdom that once united all ethnic groups in this region.
- **Religion:** References to "The Immortals" as ascending demigods are removed. The populace views religion through a monotheistic lens. Both Thyatian and Karameikan faiths are treated as monotheistic and largely syncretic branches of the same solar worship.

## Ethnic Groups

The peoples of Karameikos represent distinct archetypes of Slavic culture, providing flavor and fueling character dynamics. While territorial divisions exist, racism is mostly superstitious and directed towards the Stiganos (the settings' "gypsies"). Player character ethnicity is a cosmetic choice, relevant mostly for roleplaying social customs.

### 1. Slavani (Slavs)

**Archetype:** Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia & Herzegovina
**Population:** 35-40%

The most numerous folk in the Duchy, Slavani are the backbone of the middle lands—farmers, carpenters, artisans, and petty merchants. They are the most integrated into the Thyatian administration; it is through their cooperation that Karameikos avoids direct military conflict with the Empire. Duke Stefan Karameikos and the ruling houses have strong Slavan bloodlines.

- **Appearance:** Plain unbleached linens, leather aprons for craftsmen; festive garlands and embroidered shirts for celebrations.
- **Language & Dialect:** "Pure" Traladaran speech with clear consonants and practical phrasing. They frequently adopt Thyatian (Greek-sounding) names to signal status and loyalty to the administration.
- **Economy:** Markets, woodworking, river fishing, cooperative trade. Many market towns are Slavani-majority.
- **Social Structure:** Organized around village councils and hereditary guilds. Deeply religious, observing the feast days of the Saints of the Shining Father.

#### Naming Guide

### 3. Polanici

**Archetype:** Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Western Ukraine
**Population:** 12-18%

Found near larger settlements, Polanici are masters of horse-breeding and the grain economy. They are open to the world and trade-oriented. They practice "The Shearing"—a custom where children at age 13 must leave their father's home. Travel is a virtue; a long journey (or "Hajdu") is a mark of success.

- **Appearance:** Riding tunics, decorated bridles; bald heads for men who choose the traveler's life, or growing a single "war-braid" for every battle survived.
- **Language & Dialect:** Soft vowels; trade jargon full of guild cant.
- **Economy:** Horses, grain, river barges, market contracts.
- **Social Structure:** Labor cooperatives and adoptive brotherhoods. Blood lineage matters less than one's word and mutual debt. Status is built on donations to the Church and horse racing.

### 4. Vlastari

**Archetype:** Romania, Montenegro, Vlachs
**Population:** 8-12%

Mountain clans and shepherds bound by clan honor and ancient rites. Deeply superstitious and often isolated, Vlastari are dismissed as rough and poor by lowlanders. They form alliances through blood-oaths and arranged marriages that involve days of haggling.

- **Appearance:** Sheepskin coats (suba), heavy boots, clan sashes, and inherited daggers defended with one's life.
- **Language & Dialect:** Technical, staccato dialect; strong oral poetic tradition.
- **Economy:** Livestock, mountain pastures, minor metalwork.
- **Social Structure:** Clan elders, blood feuds, and protective pagan charms against the "night horrors." While they accept the Shining Father, they are suspected of bargaining with darker things to protect their flocks.

### 5. Derevei

**Archetype:** Russia (Northern/Siberian), Belarus, Northern Ukraine, Scandinavia
**Population:** 4-6%

Scattered forest folk, hunters, and trappers who know the woods better than they know civilization. They view land ownership as absurd; the forest is shared. They are silent, stoic people who gather only to trade furs for salt and iron. They are rumored to treat with forest spirits.

- **Appearance:** Dark furs, moss-green cloaks, bone amulets. They cut their hair rarely—only at the birth of a first child or retirement from the hunt—tying the cut braid to an ancient oak.
- **Language & Dialect:** Small vocabulary rich in homonyms; they speak little.
- **Economy:** Timber, furs, foraging, herbalism.
- **Social Structure:** Small "winter-camps" of 3-8 families. They practice "Winter Commons"—pooling food for the cold months. They revere the Shining Father but rarely visit churches, leading to accusations of heresy.
- **Mercenary Note:** Their numbers are bolstered by northern mercenaries (Nordic types) who find the Derevei culture compatible with their own.

#### Naming Guide

Derevei names are East Slavic or Nordic, harsh and wintry.

- **Male Names:** Alexey, Anatoly, Artem, Bjorn, Boris, Dmitry, Egor, Einar, Fedor, Gennady, Grigory, Gunnar, Hakon, Harald, Igor, Ilaron, Ivan, Ivar, Kirill, Konstantin, Leif, Leonid, Maksim, Miharan, Mikhail, Nikita, Nikolai, Olaf, Oleg, Pavel, Petr, Ragnar, Roman, Sergey, Stanislav, Sten, Sven, Torstein, Vadim, Valery, Vasily, Victor, Vidar, Vihren, Vladimir, Vukasar, Vyacheslav, Yaroslav, Yuri, Zdravar.

### 6. Stigani

**Archetype:** Roma / Travelers
**Population:** 1-3%

Mobile artisans and carnival folk who wander between settlements. Metalworkers, musicians, and animal handlers living in tight kin-groups. They adhere to a complex internal code of honor that rarely applies to outsiders ("gaje"). Accepted for their labor but feared for their reputation.

- **Appearance:** Bronze skin, dark hair. Bright travel clothes, veils and painted faces/palms for women.
- **Language & Dialect:** A language of gestures and hand-signs overlaid on a chaotic dialect of Traladaran.
- **Economy:** Tinkering, entertainment, horse-trading.
- **Social Structure:** Matriarchal influence is strong. They worship the Shining Father ostensibly to blend in, but many view it as a performance for the settled folk.

#### Naming Guide

Stigani names are exotic, often borrowing from other cultures but twisting them, or using names that sound "foreign" to local ears.

### 7. Thyatians (Imperial Occupiers)

**Archetype:** Byzantine Empire / Constantinople / Rome
**Population:** 15-20% (Concentrated in cities, keeps, and officer corps)

The ruling class of the Grand Duchy, Thyatians are the administrators, knights, and military officers who enforce Duke Stefan's law. They view themselves as the bringers of civilization to a wild land. While some have integrated, many maintain a distinct cultural separation, valuing the "Thyatian Way"—efficiency, discipline, and imperial hierarchy. They are often viewed as arrogant interlopers by the native Traladarans (Saraps, Slavans, etc.) but are respected for their steel and organizational might.

- **Appearance:** Shorter, military-style haircuts; trimmed beards or clean-shaven faces; preference for tunics, togas, and practical military garb in imperial reds or purples.
- **Language & Dialect:** They speak the Common tongue (Thyatian) with a refined, precise accent, often sprinkling in legalistic or military terminology.
- **Economy:** Administration, military service, large-scale trade, tax collection.
- **Social Structure:** Strictly hierarchical and meritocratic in theory, but often nepotistic in practice. They worship the Shining Father but with more formal, structured rites similar to their Sol Invictus.

## Religious Context: The Shining Father

Religion in Karameikos is strictly monotheistic, centered on **The Shining Father** (_Siyaen_ in Traladaran). This is a localized, simplified version of the Thyatian Church of the Heliocosmos, designed for cultural assimilation.

**The Tenets:**

- **The Sun:** Grants life, breaks darkness, keeps evil at bay.
- **The Pact:** The faithful repay the Sun with honest labor, tithes, and defense of the home (men) or preservation of knowledge/culture (women).
- **Saints:** The Church acknowledges a pantheon of Saints—mortals who lived exemplary lives. Clerics and Paladins ("Bogotiri") choose a patron Saint to emulate.

**Popular Saints:**

- **St. Radomir:** Harvest & Seed.
- **St. Ludmila:** Healing & Childbirth.
- **St. Bronimir:** Smiths & Metal.
- **St. Zorka:** Dawn, Travelers & The "Shearing" (Youth).
- **St. Vlastomir:** Oaths & Law.
- **St. Darina:** Animals & Fertility.
- **St. Bora:** Storms & Weather.
- **St. Milogor:** Barns & Fire Protection.
- **St. Veselin:** Music & Stories.
- **St. Moran:** Death & Memory.
- **St. Rodan:** Shepherds.
- **St. Zdenko:** Trade & Justice.
