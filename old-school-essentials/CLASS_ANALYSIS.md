# Class Power Level Analysis

Version: 1.3.0 (2025-12-31)

> This analysis evaluates all classes in the OSE house rules based on combat power, utility, scaling, autonomy, and entry requirements.

---

## Methodology

Evaluating across **five axes**:

1. **Combat Power** — damage output, survivability, action economy
2. **Utility** — exploration, dungeon crawling, non-combat problem solving
3. **Scaling** — how power grows at tiers 1 (1–4), 2 (5–8), 3 (9+)
4. **Autonomy** — dependence on resources, party composition, environment
5. **Entry Cost** — attribute requirements, XP progression, constraints

Rating scale: **S > A > B > C > D** (S = dominant, D = niche/weak)

---

## Basic Classes

| Class          | Combat | Utility | Scaling | Autonomy | Entry | **Overall** |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | -------- | ----- | ----------- |
| **Fighter**    | S      | C       | A       | A        | Easy  | **A+**      |
| **Magic User** | B→S    | A       | S       | C        | Easy  | **A-**      |
| **Cleric**     | A      | A       | A       | B        | Easy  | **A**       |
| **Thief**      | C      | S       | B       | B        | Easy  | **B+**      |

### Fighter — A+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Cleave** is the defining feature: 1 extra attack at L1, scaling to 4 at L13 with 10' move at L9. This creates snowball combat potential unmatched by any class.
- No resource management — always at full power.
- Best THAC0 progression, unrestricted armor/weapons.
- Racial HD + max L1 HP + any race combo = highest early survivability.

**Weaknesses:**

- Zero magical utility; relies entirely on party or items.
- Exploration is purely gear-dependent.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Cleave and L9 cleave-move add major action economy; max HP at L1 + racial HD buffs early survivability.
- Diminishes: No meaningful drawbacks added.

**Scaling:** Cleave scales with enemies defeated, making Fighters better against hordes than solo bosses. L9+ 10' cleave move is transformative.

**Verdict:** The most reliable chassis. Never bad, never resource-starved.

---

### Magic User — A- Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Arcane Sense** provides free item identification (1 turn), saving spell slots.
- Access to _Sleep_ as fallback + complete spell list = maximum flexibility.
- Spells scale exponentially; _Fireball_, _Web_, _Haste_ define encounter outcomes.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Grog** mitigates but doesn't solve fragility (1/3 HD hireling, no replacement if dead).
- 1 spell/day at L1 is brutal; completely reliant on party.
- **No RC weapon proficiencies** limits combat contribution further.
- Must _find_ or _research_ new spells (1,000 gp/level, 2 weeks) — expensive.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Arcane Sense reduces slot burn on basic item ID; grog option softens L1 fragility.
- Diminishes: No free spells on level-up and random starting spell slow early growth and autonomy.

**Scaling:** B-tier at L1–4, A-tier at L5–8, S-tier at L9+. Exponential power curve.

**Autonomy:** Very low early (C), very high late (A). The quintessential "investment" class.

**Verdict:** High ceiling, low floor. Party-dependent early, game-warping late, but house rules slow the climb.

---

### Cleric — A Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Cure Disease (ritual)** is campaign-defining utility; virulent diseases need Turn Undead vs HD (Black Plague = 5 HD), but even 4-in-6 for common diseases is reliable.
- **Holy Sense** identifies divine artifacts, cursed items, and consecrated/desecrated areas — excellent dungeon utility.
- **Faith's Influence** gives +1/+2 to social checks vs believers — situational but free.
- Turn Undead scales with level; high-level Clerics trivialize undead encounters.
- Full armor + shield + solid HP = respectable frontline.

**Weaknesses:**

- Spell selection locked to divine list; no battlefield control comparable to M-U.
- _Cure Light Wounds_ fallback pressures toward healer role.
- Must find/research new spells like M-U.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Cure Disease ritual, Holy Sense, and Faith's Influence make the cleric more than a heal-bot.
- Diminishes: None notable; power mostly rises.

**Scaling:** Consistent A-tier throughout. Never weak, never dominant.

**Verdict:** The Swiss army knife. Healing, undead removal, disease curing, item identification, and passable combat in one package.

---

### Thief — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Custom Skill Progression** (4 increases at L1, 2/level) with 85% caps is well-balanced; never trivial, never impossible.
- **Focused Investment** can spike a key skill early (e.g., two L1 increases to reach 40%).
- **Iterative Attempts** allow retries at time cost — excellent for patient play.
- **Environmental Edge** (+10/+20 for situational advantages) rewards clever play.
- Only class with Heroic-tier skill access to locks and traps per the Skills chapter.
- **Read Languages** + **Scroll Use** add niche, campaign-swingy utility.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Combat is abysmal.** No cleave, no spells, no special attacks. D20 to-hit with daggers.
- Relies on surprise/backstab for damage relevance.
- Skills start at 10% (25% Climb); failure rate is high at L1–4.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Custom progression allows meaningful L1 spikes; iterative attempts and environmental edge make dungeon play less binary.
- Diminishes: Spreading points is a trap at L1; without focus the class underperforms.

**Scaling:** C-tier combat throughout. Utility scales from B to A as skills improve.

**Autonomy:** High — skills work regardless of party composition.

**Verdict:** The exploration specialist. Invaluable in dungeons, liability in open combat.

## Demihuman Classes

| Class           | Combat | Utility | Scaling | Autonomy | Entry      | **Overall** |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **Elf**         | A      | A       | B       | A        | 11         | **A**       |
| **Drow**        | A      | A       | B       | B        | 11 (d6 HD) | **A**       |
| **Dwarf**       | A      | B       | A       | A        | 11         | **A-**      |
| **Half-Orc**    | A      | C       | B       | A        | 11 (d6 HD) | **B+**      |
| **Gnome**       | B      | A       | B       | B        | 11         | **B+**      |
| **Svirnefblin** | B      | A       | B       | C        | 11         | **B+**      |
| **Duergar**     | B      | B       | B       | B        | 11         | **B+**      |
| **Halfling**    | B      | B       | B       | B        | 11         | **B+**      |
| **Half-Elf**    | B      | A       | B       | A        | 11         | **B+**      |

### Elf — A Tier (Top Demihuman)

**Strengths:**

- **Dual Spell Lists** (M-U + Illusionist) + 2 extra beginner spells = best arcane flexibility in the game.
- **Elven Finesse** allows DEX-to-hit/damage with elven weapons — enables DEX-primary builds.
- **Detect Secrets** (2-in-6 search, 1-in-6 sense deception) is unique utility.
- **Sleep/Paralysis Immunity** is massive defensive power.
- **Sylvan Sense** for magic detection.

**Weaknesses:**

- Level cap (10) limits late-game.
- Low-Light Vision replaces Infravision — worse in pitch darkness.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Dual spell lists + extra beginner spells and finesse push Elf to top-tier versatility.
- Diminishes: Infravision downgrade reduces dungeon dominance.

**Scaling:** Strong L1–10, then capped. Best-in-class for that span.

**Verdict:** The complete package for levels 1–10. Spells, combat, immunity, detection.

---

### Drow — A Tier

**Strengths:**

- **d6 Racial HD** (vs d4 for most) = tankier than Elf.
- **Dark Assassination** (+4 to hit OR double damage in pitch dark vs unaware) is devastating in the right environment.
- **Dex Finesse (Drow arms)** = DEX-based melee like Elf.
- **Divine spellcasting** (cleric list, plus _web_ at L3) adds strong support/utility. _Web_ + Dark Assassination is a devastating combo: cast _web_ to immobilize, then execute helpless targets in darkness.
- **Poisoncraft** (1d3 doses/week from giant spiders) provides ongoing resource generation.
- **Full Sleep/Paralysis Immunity**.
- **Infravision 90'** — superior to Low-Light in dungeons.
- **Detect Secret Doors / Listen at Doors** (2-in-6) are reliable dungeon utilities.

**Weaknesses:**

- Dark Assassination is environment-gated (pitch darkness only).
- Poisoncraft requires friendly giant spiders — DM-dependent availability.
- **Light Sensitivity** (-2 to hit, -1 AC in bright light) is a real daylight penalty.
- Social stigma (lore-dependent) may limit topside play.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Adds assassination package, finesse, poisoncraft, and sleep/paralysis immunity on top of cleric casting.
- Diminishes: Light sensitivity and social stigma make surface play materially weaker.

**Scaling:** Excellent in Underdark campaigns; merely good elsewhere.

**Verdict:** The premiere darkness specialist. Environment-dependent but powerful.

---

### Dwarf — A- Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Stout Fortune** (1/day reroll vs Death/Poison/Paralysis/Petrification/Spells) is the best save reroll in the game — covers most lethal threats.
- **Hardy Growth** (+1 HP/level + roll twice, keep higher) creates the tankiest demihuman by far.
- **Attack Giant Foes** (+2 to hit vs larger-than-human) is frequently relevant.
- Infravision 60', detect construction tricks, stonework expertise.

**Weaknesses:**

- No spellcasting.
- No finesse option — STR-locked.
- Level cap (12).

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Stout Fortune + Hardy Growth massively raise durability over core dwarf.
- Diminishes: None notable beyond existing caps.

**Scaling:** Consistent A- from L1–12. Never spikes, never falls.

**Verdict:** The unkillable frontline. Best raw survivability of any demihuman.

---

### Half-Orc — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **d6 Racial HD** — same tankiness advantage as Drow.
- **Grim Tenacity** (save vs Death to act at 0 HP until end of next round) enables clutch plays. The save requirement balances the power.
- **Stubborn Vitality** (CON damage -1, improving at L5/L9) synergizes with the CON-bleed death system.
- **Brutal Grapple** (1d4 unarmed/grapple damage) makes grappling viable.
- **Back-Stab** and **Thieving Skills** (HS/MS/PP) provide real ambush and infiltration utility.
- **Low-Light Vision**.

**Weaknesses:**

- No spellcasting.
- No detection abilities.
- Grim Tenacity requires passing a save — not reliable.
- Retainers suffer a loyalty penalty, limiting long-term hireling play.
- Level cap (8) limits late-game.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Adds grim tenacity + CON bleed mitigation, boosting survivability over core.
- Diminishes: Low-Light replaces infravision and retainer penalties still sting.

**Scaling:** Solid B+ throughout. The "second wind" class.

**Verdict:** The berserker chassis. Excels at not dying when they should.

---

### Gnome — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Blink Away** (1/day invisibility on taking damage until next turn) is excellent defensive escape.
- **Arcane Magic** (choose M-U or Illusionist list at creation) provides flexibility.
- **Terrain Hiding** (4-in-6 forest, scaling down) is solid stealth.
- **Small Defense** (+2 AC vs larger-than-human) helps survivability.
- Infravision 90'.
- **Detect Construction Tricks** (2-in-6) supports dungeon delving.

**Weaknesses:**

- Locked spell list choice at creation.
- Small size limits weapon options.
- Terrain Hiding is environment-dependent.
- Level cap (8) limits late-game.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Blink Away and spell list choice are big survivability/flexibility boosts.
- Diminishes: Core d4 HD and level cap keep the chassis fragile.

**Scaling:** B+ throughout. Good all-rounder with defensive escape.

**Verdict:** The survivable small caster. Blink Away is surprisingly clutch.

---

### Svirnefblin — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Stone Camouflage** (4-in-6 unnoticed against stone underground vs creatures without infra-vision/tremorsense) is exceptional ambush potential.
- **Gem Sense** (evaluate gems, detect magical alteration, sense veins within 30') is unique economic utility.
- **Sure-Footed** (half fall damage on rock/earth, save vs Breath to grab edge) provides excellent dungeon survival.
- Blend into Stone (base ability) + Stone Camouflage = best underground stealth.
- **Defensive Bonus** (+2 AC vs larger-than-human) and **Illusion Resistance** (+2 saves vs illusions) are real survivability perks.
- **Stone Murmurs** and **earth elemental language** add deep-underground intel utility.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Heavily environment-gated** — underground stone environments only.
- Gem Sense is economic, not combat-relevant.
- Above ground, loses most advantages.
- **Light Sensitivity** (-2 to hit, -1 AC in bright light) is a consistent surface penalty.
- Level cap (8) limits late-game.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Stone Camouflage + Gem Sense add strong stealth and economic leverage underground.
- Diminishes: Light sensitivity and strict terrain gating remain hard limits.

**Scaling:** S-tier underground, C-tier above ground. Extremely variable.

**Verdict:** The Underdark specialist. Unmatched in their niche, mediocre outside it.

---

### Duergar — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Iron Will** (1/day reroll vs Poison or Spells) is decent but narrower than Dwarf's Stout Fortune.
- **Stone Stealth** (stealth in all exposed stonework, not just underground) expands usability.
- **Harm Giant Foes** (+2 damage vs larger-than-human) complements the Dwarf's +2 to hit.
- **Mental Powers** (enlarge, invisibility, shrinking, heat) scale 1/day/level and are combat-meaningful.
- **Infravision 90'** and underground stealth (3-in-6) add dungeon edge.
- Base features: Detect Construction Tricks, Detect Room Traps, Listening at Doors (all 2-in-6).

**Weaknesses:**

- Iron Will covers fewer saves than Stout Fortune.
- No HP bonuses like Hardy Growth.
- Level cap (10) vs Dwarf's (12).
- **Light Sensitivity** (-2 to hit, -1 AC in bright light) is a constant surface penalty.
- Weapon restrictions (no longbows or two-handed swords) reduce peak damage options.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Stone Stealth, Iron Will, and Harm Giant Foes stack on already-strong mental powers.
- Diminishes: Light sensitivity and weapon limits keep them niche.

**Scaling:** B+ throughout. Utility spikes from mental powers.

**Verdict:** Distinct from Dwarf once mental powers are in play; still less durable overall.

---

### Halfling — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Lucky** (1/day reroll failed save OR Hide check) is flexible.
- **Stout Heart** (+2 to saves vs charm/dominate/possess/compel) stacks with already-excellent saves for exceptional mental defense.
- **Terrain Hiding** (5-in-6 forest, 4-in-6 urban, 3-in-6 dungeon) is the best non-class hiding.
- **Underfoot Defense** (-1 to hit from larger-than-human in melee) provides passive defense.
- **Small Combat Edge** (+2 AC vs larger-than-human, +1 missile attacks) helps in skirmishes.
- Best save bonuses in base OSE.

**Weaknesses:**

- No spellcasting.
- Size limits weapon choices.
- Hiding requires cover and reroll every 1d3 rounds.
- Level cap (8) — lowest of all demihumans.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Lucky and terrain hiding make stealth more reliable than core hiding rules. Stout Heart significantly enhances mental defense, making Halflings exceptionally resistant to mind control.
- Diminishes: Level cap and small-weapon limits still constrain growth.

**Scaling:** B+ at L1–8, then hard-capped.

**Verdict:** The resilient survivor. Best saves in the game + Stout Heart + Lucky makes them nearly immune to mental control; excellent at not being hit; limited offense.

---

### Half-Elf — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Mixed Finesse** (DEX-to-hit/damage with elven OR human weapons) is the most flexible finesse ability.
- **See Through Pretense** (1-in-6 passive lie/disguise/motive detection) provides unique social insight.
- **Keen Awareness** (surprised only on 1-3 when party is surprised) grants 50% chance to act during surprise rounds.
- **Diplomat** (+1 Reaction from non-hostile creatures + 1/encounter morale reroll during parley) is unique social power.
- **Sleep/Paralysis Immunity**.
- **Sylvan Sense** for magic detection.
- **Low-Light Vision**.

**Weaknesses:**

- No unique combat abilities.
- Diplomat is social-only; morale reroll requires non-hostility.
- Level cap (12) but no compensating combat power.
- Jack-of-all-trades, master of none.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: See Through Pretense and Keen Awareness transform Half-Elf into the "outsider observer" with strong intrigue utility and defensive awareness. Mixed finesse and diplomat give the class a clearer niche than core.
- Diminishes: Infravision downgrade to Low-Light reduces dungeon edge.

**Scaling:** B+ throughout. Excels in social situations and avoids surprise; lacks combat burst.

**Verdict:** The wary diplomat. Keen social insight and defensive awareness make them invaluable in intrigue and dangerous territory; limited direct combat power.

## Advanced Classes

| Class           | Combat | Utility | Scaling | Autonomy | Entry                   | **Overall** |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| **Paladin**     | A      | A       | A       | B        | CHA 13+, WIS 9+, Lawful | **A**       |
| **Ranger**      | A      | A       | B       | C        | STR 13+, WIS 9+         | **A-**      |
| **Assassin**    | S      | B       | S       | B        | DEX 13+, INT 9+         | **A-**      |
| **Barbarian**   | A      | B       | A       | C        | STR 13+, CON 9+         | **A-**      |
| **Knight**      | A      | B       | A       | A        | STR 13+, CHA 9+         | **B+**      |
| **Acrobat**     | B      | A       | A       | A        | DEX 13+, STR 9+         | **B+**      |
| **Druid**       | B      | A       | B       | C        | WIS 13+, CHA 9+         | **B+**      |
| **Bard**        | B      | A       | B       | B        | CHA 13+, DEX 9+         | **B+**      |
| **Illusionist** | B      | S       | A       | C        | INT 13+, DEX 9+         | **B+**      |

### Paladin — A Tier (Top Advanced Class)

**Strengths:**

- **Donation Zeal** (1.5x XP from donated gold) accelerates leveling.
- **Dedication to Law & Good** (+1 to hit evil ≥ HD, +2 damage vs evil < HD) is constantly relevant.
- **Divert the Wicked** (taunt evil creatures) provides tactical control.
- **Sanctified Sense** (60' evil detection, evil item identification) exceeds Cleric's Holy Sense range.
- **Clean of Body** (immunity to common disease + 2-in-6/1-in-6 cure) overlaps Cleric's ritual.
- **Warhorse** at L4 is a major mobility/combat upgrade in open-field play.
- Lay on Hands, Turn Undead, spellcasting at higher levels.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Lawful alignment required** — anathema constraints.
- Donation requirement (10% minimum) vs optional philanthropy for others.
- CHA 13+ is a demanding requirement.
- **Vow of Humility** caps magic items (one suit of armor, one shield, one melee weapon).

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Donation Zeal, anti-evil bonuses, and improved detection push Paladin above core.
- Diminishes: Item cap and donation floor are intentionally punishing; class fantasy expects strict anathema play.

**Scaling:** A-tier throughout. The complete holy warrior.

**Verdict:** Best advanced class for campaigns with evil opposition (most campaigns).

---

### Ranger — A- Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Enemy Slayer** (+4 to hit, double damage vs unaware common enemies) is pseudo-assassination.
- **Enemy Slayer** also grants +1 damage vs common enemies (non-stacking with specialization).
- **Vigilant Guide** (reduce party surprise to 1-in-6, increase enemy surprise to 3-in-6 with hideout) transforms exploration.
- **Fleet in Terrain** (+10' speed in favored terrain) improves tactical mobility.
- **Terrain Skills** (Hide/Move Silently to 70%, Hear Noise to 5-in-6).
- **Awareness** (surprised only on 1) and **Tracking** make wilderness play safer and more decisive.
- **Foraging/Hunting** bonuses and pursuit edge reduce wilderness attrition.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Heavily favored-terrain-gated.** Outside favored terrain, loses Enemy Slayer, Terrain Skills, Fleet, Vigilant Guide.
- **Rough Company** (-2 to hireling Morale outside terrain) limits retinue.
- Skill caps (70%) are lower than Thief (85%).
- **Limited Possessions** (excess wealth must be donated) reduces autonomy.
- Alignment restriction (Lawful/Neutral) is a hard campaign constraint.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Favored terrain suite adds assassination-lite burst and strong exploration control.
- Diminishes: Outside terrain, the class drops toward core Ranger baseline and can feel overcosted.

**Scaling:** S-tier in favored terrain, C-tier outside. Extreme variance.

**Verdict:** The wilderness master. Devastating in their domain, ordinary elsewhere.

---

### Assassin — A- Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Assassination** is the highest single-target damage in the game. Instant death on failed save.
- **Assassination Scaling** (double damage at L5, triple at L9, quadruple at L13; -1 to enemy save per level above 9) makes high-level Assassins terrifying.
- Thief skill track for Climb, Hear Noises, Move Silently.
- Poison use.
- **Disguise mastery** and **Poison save penalty** (-2) deepen infiltration lethality.

**Weaknesses:**

- Assassination requires surprise/unaware target — setup-dependent.
- Skill track is slower than Thief (2 increases at L1, 1/level vs 4 at L1, 2/level).
- Against aware enemies, just a worse Fighter.
- Hireling restrictions until mid-levels limit domain play.
- Alignment restriction (not Lawful) can be binding.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Assassination damage scaling makes high-level kills far deadlier than core.
- Diminishes: Still gated by surprise and slow skill growth; economy of kills remains setup-heavy.

**Scaling:** B-tier against aware enemies, S-tier with setup. Quadruple damage at L13 is absurd.

**Verdict:** The alpha strike specialist. Unmatched burst damage with preparation.

---

### Barbarian — A- Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Damage Reduction** (1 non-magical, 2 at L9) is unique passive defense.
- **Battle Senses** (reduce surprise attack bonus to +2, save vs Death to prevent double damage) mitigates ambushes.
- **Charge Fury** (+2 to hit, +2+STR to damage, can charge again after kill) is mini-cleave.
- **Agile Fighting** (scaling AC bonus from L4+) stacks with armor for strong defense.
- **Strike Invulnerable Monsters** (L4) prevents hard lockouts vs magic-only foes.
- **Cure Poison** and strong foraging/hunting improve wilderness survival.
- Wilderness skills scale to 85% Climb, 70% Hide/Move Silently by L14.

**Weaknesses:**

- Damage Reduction only applies to non-magical attacks — less relevant at high levels.
- No magic item usage.
- Skill progression is slow (no increases at L1, +1/level through L9, +2/level L10–14).
- **Fear of Magic** (refuses arcane magic items/spells) is a major autonomy and power loss.
- Illiteracy at L1 can limit utility.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: DR, Battle Senses, and Charge Fury are real combat buffs over core.
- Diminishes: Core fear-of-magic rule still kneecaps long-term scaling.

**Scaling:** A- overall. Agile Fighting (+4 AC by L10), +3 HP/level post-9, and horde mustering create strong late-game despite magic refusal.

**Verdict:** The anti-ambush tank. Great in low-magic wilderness, weaker in magic-heavy play.

---

### Knight — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Retinue** (+2 hirelings, +1 at L5 and L9; +2 to attract/interview) creates largest hireling pool.
- **Noble Standing** (minimum landless Noble social status, inheritance claim) provides narrative power.
- **Shield Stand** (+2 to shield AC for self and adjacent allies, +1 Parry) is excellent defensive formation.
- **Battle Oath** (+2 Morale to hirelings, taunt opposite-alignment enemies) is encounter-defining.
- **Mounted combat** and **hospitality** privileges add real travel and logistics power.
- **Strength of Will / Beguilement** saves vs fear and mind control are elite defensive tech.

**Weaknesses:**

- No unique damage abilities.
- Relies on hirelings — effectiveness scales with party composition.
- Noble Standing is campaign-dependent.
- Chivalric code and no missile weapons constrain tactics.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Retinue and Shield Stand significantly raise team-level durability.
- Diminishes: Core behavioral constraints still limit tactical flexibility.

**Scaling:** B at L1–4 (few hirelings), A- at L5+ (full retinue).

**Verdict:** The leader class. Maximizes hireling-based strategies.

---

### Acrobat — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Dodge Die** (d4→d10 added to AC after being hit; if AC > attack, take 1 damage) is excellent damage mitigation.
- Save reroll (1/day vs Breath or Spells/Wands/Staves) if unimpeded.
- **Tumbling Strike** (FA check or Charge → double damage, +4 vs unaware; failure = 1 damage, lose ability for encounter) is high-risk/high-reward.
- **Base Tome skills** start very high (CS 87%, TW 60%, FA 25% at L1); house rules replace with custom progression matching Thief structure.
- **Evasion** (negates +2 to hit on retreat) and **Jumping** add strong mobility tricks.

**Weaknesses:**

- Dodge Die disabled if prone, grappled, or movement impeded — conditional.
- Tumbling Strike failure cost is brutal.
- No lock/trap skills — not a Thief replacement.
- Encumbrance and armor restrictions (leather/no shields) limit frontline use.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Dodge Die and save reroll make the acrobat far tougher than core.
- Diminishes: Encumbrance and armor limits remain harsh.

**Scaling:** B+ throughout. Dodge Die scales well (d10 at L13).

**Verdict:** The mobile skirmisher. High skill floor, conditional ceiling.

---

### Druid — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Herbal Salves** (1d3 HP + double natural healing, 1/day per creature) is free healing in favored terrain.
- **Antivenom Craft** (5-in-6 cure poison, -1 per poison level above I) is reliable poison removal.
- **Animal Companion** (up to 1/3 Druid HD, no Morale checks, hireling limit) is a free pet.
- **Wild Bonds** (+2 to calm animals/beasts including dire beasts).
- **Pass Without Trace**, **Energy Resistance** (+2 saves vs fire/lightning), and **Shape Change** (L7) add strong utility and defense.
- Spellcasting.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Favored Terrain Vow** locks Herbal Salves to specific terrain.
- **Wild Bonds** (-4 to non-animal hireling Morale) severely limits human retainers.
- Must find new favored terrain + accomplish deed to expand.
- Alignment lock (Neutral) and metal-armor restrictions are hard constraints.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Herbal salves, antivenom, and animal companions add strong wilderness sustain.
- Diminishes: Favored terrain vow narrows a class that already had strict equipment limits.

**Scaling:** B+ in favored terrain, C outside. Animal companion scales with level.

**Verdict:** The nature specialist. Excellent utility in wilderness, limited in dungeons/cities.

### Bard — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Battle Songs** (forgo movement → +2 ally Morale; forgo attack → -2 enemy attack unless targeting Bard) is tactical control.
- **Stunning Flourish** (charge + hit → 1 damage + target saves vs Spell or stunned, +2 to hit stunned target) sets up allies.
- **Bardic Knowledge** (1-in-6 → 4-in-6 at L13 for obscure facts; 2-in-6 helpful, 6 = false) provides investigation utility.
- **Enchantment** (fascinate/charm outside combat) scales: persons at L1, animals at L4, monsters at L7. **Anti-Charm** (ally protection within 30') grants immunity to song-based magic and +4 save vs existing effects.
- Thief-lite skills (Pick Pockets, Move Silently, Hide in Shadows to 70%, Hear Noise to 5-in-6).
- Spellcasting (druid list from L2).

**Weaknesses:**

- Battle Songs require forgoing movement OR attack — opportunity cost.
- Bardic Knowledge has false-positive risk (6 on secondary roll = always wrong).
- Skills cap at 70% vs Thief's 85%.
- Armor restrictions (no shields, no plate) limit durability.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Battle Songs and Stunning Flourish give real tactical control beyond core enchantment.
- Diminishes: False-positive knowledge can mislead parties if overused.

**Scaling:** B+ throughout. Support role with versatile utility.

**Verdict:** The force multiplier. Best in parties with strong damage-dealers.

---

### Illusionist — B+ Tier

**Strengths:**

- **Minor Conjurations** (1 hour to create small illusion; 3-in-6 behaves, 2-in-6 feels real, 1-in-6 sound/smell; 2+INT mod maintained) provides unlimited creative utility.
- **Illusion Savvy** (disbelieve illusions by sight without interaction) is unique defense.
- **Arcane/Illusion Sense** (identify arcane items + see through illusions ≤ caster level) is the best item identification.
- Illusionist spell list.

**Weaknesses:**

- Minor Conjurations can't deal damage or interact with non-illusions — pure utility.
- Illusion spells are save-or-nothing against intelligent enemies.
- Grog availability is DM-approved for pure casters, so early-game durability is not guaranteed.

**House Rules Impact (Core + OSE HR):**

- Improves: Minor Conjurations and illusion-sense tools massively expand creative utility.
- Diminishes: Still relies on save-or-nothing effects and DM adjudication.

**Scaling:** B at L1–4 (illusions easy to disbelieve), A at L5+ (spell levels outpace enemy saves).

**Verdict:** The creative toolkit class. Rewards player ingenuity heavily.

---

## Core Rules Incorporated (Base Tome Highlights)

- Drow divine spellcasting and light sensitivity materially raise power and add a daylight tax.
- Duergar mental powers (enlarge/invisibility/shrinking/heat) add non-spell utility spikes.
- Barbarian fear of magic + agile fighting keep the chassis strong but cap long-term scaling.
- Ranger limited possessions, awareness, wilderness stealth, and tracking set the baseline beneath favored-terrain buffs.
- Paladin vow of humility and warhorse balance the class’s strong holy kit.
- Bard enchantment/anti-charm/lore and Druid shapechange/energy resistance/pass-without-trace are treated as baseline.
- Halfling missile bonus, small-size AC bonus, and Half-Orc back-stab/thieving skills are included in evaluations.

## Summary Tier List

### S Tier — None

No class is without meaningful weaknesses in this system.

### A Tier (Excellent in most situations)

| Class       | Notes                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fighter** | Cleave defines combat; no resources to manage    |
| **Elf**     | Best 1–10 demihuman; dual spell lists + immunity |
| **Paladin** | Complete package vs evil; donation XP bonus      |
| **Cleric**  | Swiss army knife; never bad                      |
| **Drow**    | Cleric casting + stealth/poison package          |

### A- Tier (Excellent with conditions)

| Class          | Notes                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Magic User** | Investment class; S-tier at L9+                     |
| **Dwarf**      | Tankiest demihuman; save reroll covers most threats |
| **Ranger**     | S-tier in favored terrain, C-tier outside           |
| **Assassin**   | S-tier with setup, B-tier without                   |
| **Barbarian**  | Agile Fighting + DR; anti-ambush tank               |

### B+ Tier (Good with niche strengths)

| Class           | Notes                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Thief**       | Exploration king; combat liability |
| **Gnome**       | Blink Away is clutch; solid caster |
| **Svirnefblin** | S-tier underground, C-tier above   |
| **Half-Orc**    | Refuses to die; d6 racial HD       |
| **Knight**      | Hireling master; formation tactics |
| **Acrobat**     | Dodge Die is excellent mitigation  |
| **Druid**       | Animal companion + terrain healing |
| **Bard**        | Party buffer; Bardic Knowledge     |
| **Illusionist** | Creative utility; best item ID     |
| **Duergar**     | Mental powers + stone stealth      |
| **Halfling**    | Nearly immune to mental control    |
| **Half-Elf**    | Wary diplomat; see through lies    |

### B Tier (Solid but outclassed)

_(None currently)_

---

## Design Observations

### Intentional Hierarchies

- Elves > Half-Elves (folklore accuracy, confirmed design intent)
- Dwarves > Duergar (surface vs Underdark niche)
- Fighter > all non-magic classes in sustained combat

### Environment-Gated Power

- Drow, Svirnefblin, Ranger, Druid swing 2+ tiers based on terrain
- This is good OSR design — player choices matter

### Resource-Gated Power

- Magic User, Assassin need setup/spells to shine
- Fighter and Dwarf are always "on"; Barbarian is constrained by anti-magic rules

### x10 XP Scaling Impact

- The house rule grants x10 faster leveling (1 XP per 1 sp instead of 1 gp)
- Classes that "come online" at mid-levels (Magic User L5+, Ranger in terrain, Barbarian L4+) reach power spikes faster
- This partially offsets Magic User's slow early game and Barbarian's delayed Agile Fighting

### Potential Concerns

1. **Ranger** is either dominant or mediocre — no middle ground
2. **Duergar** still trails Dwarf in durability, but now has distinct mental powers to justify a niche
3. **Magic User** spell acquisition costs may over-penalize low-magic or low-treasure campaigns
4. **Drow** can eclipse other demihumans in darkness-heavy play despite surface penalties

---

## Balance System Analysis: Is This A Good System?

### Overall Assessment: **Yes, with caveats.**

The OSE house rules + Advanced Fantasy classes create a healthier, more nuanced balance system than core OSE. However, it trades simplicity for complexity and introduces new pressure points that require active DM management.

---

### Strengths of the Balance Framework

#### 1. **Legitimate Power Gradation (No False Equality)**

The tier system correctly reflects that classes **are not equal**, and this is _intentional_ design rather than oversight:

- **S Tier = None** is philosophically sound. No class lacks meaningful weaknesses in dungeons, wilderness, or social situations. This prevents dominant strategies while maintaining identity.
- **A Tier (5 classes)** have broad appeal and few bad matchups: Fighter, Elf, Paladin, Cleric, Drow. These represent the "safe picks" that work in most campaigns.
- **A- Tier (5 classes)** require tactical play or campaign specificity to shine: Magic User (needs L5+), Dwarf (needs durability encounters), Ranger (favored terrain), Assassin (setup), Barbarian (anti-ambush).
- **B+ Tier (12 classes)** are specialized but viable: Thief (dungeon), Gnome (blink away), Half-Orc (tenacity), Knight (hirelings), Acrobat (dodge), Druid (wilderness), Bard (support), Illusionist (creativity), Duergar (mental powers), Svirnefblin (underground), Halfling (mental control immunity), Half-Elf (wary observer).
- **B Tier (0 classes)** — No classes remain at this tier after recent improvements to Halfling and Half-Elf.

**Why this is good:**

- The distribution avoids the false middle-ground where every class feels interchangeable.
- Tier gaps feel justified by specific mechanical differences (Cleave vs no Cleave, spellcasting vs none, environment-gating, resource costs).
- All 23 classes are B+ or higher, ensuring no "trap" options while maintaining meaningful power differences.

#### 2. **Niches Override Raw Power (Environment-Gating Works)**

The 2–3 tier swings in power based on campaign type are **deliberate and healthy**:

- **Underdark campaign**: Drow, Svirnefblin, Duergar jump 2–3 tiers. Surface classes (Ranger, Druid, Halfling) drop proportionally.
- **Wilderness campaign**: Ranger (favored terrain), Druid (animal companion), Barbarian (foraging), Cleric (disease curing) dominate.
- **Urban intrigue**: Thief, Bard, Illusionist, Half-Elf (diplomat) pull ahead; Barbarian and Druid stall.
- **Dungeon crawl**: Fighter, Cleric, Thief, Dwarf are always relevant. Magic User scales in.

This is **excellent OSR design**. Classes are situation-dependent, which means:

- Player choice matters beyond "pick the strongest option."
- Campaign selection naturally creates varied party compositions.
- A "weak" class excels in the right context.

#### 3. **The 5-Axis Evaluation Is Sound**

Breaking power into Combat / Utility / Scaling / Autonomy / Entry avoids false unidimensionality:

- **Combat Power** alone doesn't define class strength (Thief is D/C-tier combat, B+ overall).
- **Utility** can carry classes (Bard, Illusionist, Acrobat succeed despite C-tier combat).
- **Scaling** matters more than L1 power — Magic User jumps from B→A-→S over 9 levels.
- **Autonomy** penalizes gated classes (Magic User needs spells, Ranger needs terrain) but rewards flexible ones.
- **Entry Cost** is the least impactful axis here, but it explains why some classes are limited to specific races or alignments.

This prevents oversimplified "Fighter > Thief" assessment and admits nuance.

#### 4. **House Rules Amplify Niches Without Flattening Tiers**

The house rules (x10 XP, custom skill progressions, class-specific abilities) \*_enhance_ differentiation rather than homogenizing:

| Class          | House Rule Impact                              | Tier Effect                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fighter**    | Cleave (from base)                             | Unchanged (already A+)                                |
| **Magic User** | None added                                     | Unchanged (investment class)                          |
| **Cleric**     | Cure Disease ritual, Holy Sense                | Unchanged (already A, already strong)                 |
| **Thief**      | Custom skill progression (4 at L1, 2/level)    | B+, not C; custom progression creates decision points |
| **Paladin**    | Donation Zeal (1.5x XP)                        | A-tier → A (accelerates leveling, softens entry)      |
| **Ranger**     | Favored terrain suite                          | Remains A- (already gated; HR clarifies gating)       |
| **Barbarian**  | DR, Battle Senses, Agile Fighting, Charge Fury | B→A- (transformation through layered abilities)       |
| **Magic User** | x10 XP scaling                                 | B→A- (reaches L5 spike faster via 1 XP per sp)        |

**Key insight**: The house rules don't flatten the tiers; they **clarify and strengthen niches** without buffing the already-strong or nerfing the weak.

---

### Weaknesses & Pressure Points

#### 1. **Extreme Environment-Gating Creates Feast-or-Famine Play**

**Problem**: Ranger, Druid, Svirnefblin, and Drow can swing 2–3 tiers based on terrain. This is good _design_, but it requires **rigid campaign commitment**:

- A Ranger in a non-favored-terrain campaign is C-tier, not A-.
- A Svirnefblin in a surface-heavy game is C-tier; in underdark, S-tier.
- A Drow picked for flavor in a sunlit campaign is mechanically penalized by -2 to hit, -1 AC in bright light.

**Impact**: Players must **trust the DM's campaign type** at character creation. If campaign pivots (dungeon focus → city intrigue), some classes become liabilities.

**Mitigation**: Transparent campaign briefing. "This is a 70% Underdark campaign" is essential pre-creation communication.

#### 2. **Magic User Early Game Weakness Is Real, Not Just Flavor**

**Problem**: A Magic User at L1–4 is not just "fragile" — they're **actively bad**.

- 1 spell/day doesn't scale with encounter count.
- Grog (if available) is a hireling with 1 HP.
- No special abilities, no skill progression, no defensive tech.
- If a magic-light campaign (few treasure = few spells found), the class crawls to L5.

**Impact**: Magic Users in low-treasure campaigns may remain B/C-tier through much of Tier 1 (L1–4). The x10 XP house rule helps by reaching L5 faster (28 XP vs 2,500 gp baseline), but still leaves a power cliff.

**Verdict**: Acceptable if table accepts high-variance power curves. Problem if the campaign expects consistent party power.

#### 3. **No Classes Remain in B Tier (Resolved)**

**Previous Issue**: Half-Elf (B-tier) lacked a distinct niche and couldn't reach higher tiers.

**Resolution**: See Through Pretense (1-in-6 passive lie/disguise detection) + Keen Awareness (50% surprise avoidance) create the "outsider observer" archetype:

- Strong intrigue utility (detect deception passively during conversations)
- Defensive awareness (acts during surprise 50% of the time)
- Combined with Diplomat, Half-Elf now has B+ placement

**Impact**: Half-Elf and Halfling both upgraded to B+ through distinct defensive/social niches. The lowest tier is now B+ (10 classes), ensuring all demihuman options are viable.

**Note**: Halfling reaches B+ through Stout Heart + Lucky + best saves (near-immunity to mental control). Half-Elf reaches B+ through See Through Pretense + Keen Awareness + Diplomat (wary social observer).

#### 4. **Assassination Is Hyperscalar at High Levels**

**Problem**: Assassin damage at L13+ (4x damage, -1 to enemy save per level above 9) becomes degenerate:

- A L15 Assassin has -6 to enemy save vs assassination.
- Most monsters fail the save, guaranteeing instant death.
- In campaigns that reach L13+, an Assassin becomes a "I kill the boss, encounter ends" button.

**Impact**: High-level Assassins trivialize single-target encounters. This is partly intentional (specialization reward), but the _degree_ of scaling may be excessive.

**Mitigation**: Encounters at L13+ should include multiple high-HD targets, poison resistance, or assassination countermeasures (scrying, magical wards). The system assumes DM adjusts for Assassin threat.

#### 5. **Barbarian Anti-Magic Is A Double-Edged Sword**

**Problem**: Barbarian cannot use magic items or cast spells. At L9+, when enemies lean on magical damage, this becomes a hard cap:

- Magic Missile ignores AC and Damage Reduction (Barbarian's defense).
- Cone of Cold, Finger of Death, etc., can't be mitigated by class abilities.
- Mage-heavy campaigns can push Barbarian from A- toward B.

**Impact**: Barbarian is dominant in low-magic wilderness, weak against mage-heavy dungeons. Unlike Ranger (who can avoid non-terrain zones), Barbarian can't opt out.

**Verdict**: Acceptable if the campaign has resource scarcity. Problem if magic items are abundant and mages common.

#### 6. **Skill Progression Variance Is Tunable But Opaque**

**Problem**: Thief/Acrobat/Ranger/Assassin all have custom skill progressions, but they're **not comparable**:

- Thief: 85% caps, 4 increases at L1, 2/level
- Ranger: 70% caps, scaling to 85% by L14 (wilderness skills only)
- Assassin: 70% caps, 2 increases at L1, 1/level
- Acrobat: 87%/60%/25% base (house rules now custom, not specified)

**Impact**: A player comparing "which class gets better skills?" must read 4 different progressions. This is not a balance problem, but a **presentation problem**.

**Verdict**: Document skill progressions in a comparison table for clarity.

#### 7. **Paladin's Donation Requirement Punishes Success**

**Problem**: Paladin gains 1.5x XP from donated gold, but **requires 10% minimum donation** to maintain alignment. At L5+ with treasure, this is punishing:

- A Paladin with 10,000 gp must donate 1,000 gp (no choice).
- Thieves keep all treasure; Paladins can't accumulate wealth at normal rate.
- By L9+, Paladins may have half the treasure of equivalently-leveled party members.

**Impact**: A Paladin in a treasure-heavy campaign subsidizes the party. This is _intentional_ (Vow of Humility), but it makes Paladins materially weaker in campaigns where magic items determine power (high magic).

**Verdict**: Acceptable in low-magic campaigns; problematic in high-magic ones.

---

### Verdict: Specific System Evaluation

#### Does the Tier System Predict Actual Play?

**Yes, mostly.**

Classes rated A-tier (Fighter, Elf, Paladin, Cleric, Drow) are generically strong. Classes rated B-tier (Halfling, Half-Elf) require specific builds or campaigns to shine. This aligns with playtest experience.

**Edge cases where ratings falter:**

- Magic User in a 0-magic treasure campaign stays weak longer than the A- rating suggests.
- Ranger in a 0-favored-terrain campaign is C-tier, not A-.
- Assassin in an all-undead campaign loses assassination (immune to sleep), becomes B-tier.

These are all _DM-driven_, not system failures.

#### Is the x10 XP House Rule Balanced?

**Mostly, with caveats.**

Faster leveling (1 XP per 1 sp vs 1 per 1 gp) accelerates mid-level power spikes, helping:

- Magic User (reach L5 spellslinger spike faster)
- Ranger (reach L5 terrain bonuses faster)
- Barbarian (reach L4 invincible-monster access faster)

It hurts:

- Classes that don't have mid-level spikes (Fighter, Cleric already A-tier at L1)
- Classes that need _early_ power (Thief stays weak through L1–4 despite faster leveling)

**Net effect**: Narrows the gap between tiers without eliminating it. Acceptable.

#### Does the 5-Axis Methodology Prevent Oversights?

**Yes, it does.**

Using only "combat power" would rate Thief as D-tier and miss its S-tier utility. Using only "utility" would overrate Illusionist. The 5-axis approach forces holistic evaluation and prevents single-axis dominance.

#### Are There Unintended Interactions?

**Yes, a few beneficial ones:**

1. **Gnome Blink Away + Svirnefblin Stone Camouflage** = unbeatable ambush evasion (both stack).
2. **Drow Web + Dark Assassination** = devastating combo (noted in analysis).
3. **Paladin + Cleric multiclass potential** (not in system, but narrative-friendly).
4. **Barbarian + Ranger** (if both have favored terrain, synergy is strong).

These are _features_, not bugs. Multiclass and synergy rewards are healthy in OSR games.

---

### The Honest Assessment

#### What This System Does Well

1. **Eliminates dominant strategies.** No "power gaming" pick trivializes the system.
2. **Rewards player knowledge.** Understanding your class's niche makes you effective.
3. **Makes DM choice matter.** Campaign type determines viable classes, encouraging diverse play.
4. **Is internally consistent.** Tiers correlate with mechanical depth and flexibility.
5. **Admits nuance.** Classes aren't "good/bad," they're "good-at-X," "weak-at-Y."

#### What This System Requires

1. **Transparent campaign briefing.** Players must know if Underdark-heavy or surface-heavy upfront.
2. **Active DM scaling.** Assassins, Magic Users, and Barbarians need encounter adjustment.
3. **Player acceptance of inequality.** Some races/classes are mechanically weaker; this is intentional.
4. **Spell/treasure availability tracking.** Magic Users and Paladins depend on finding/earning specific resources.
5. **Clear documentation.** Skill progressions and house rule interactions need a reference sheet.

#### Is It Better Than Core OSE?

**Yes.**

Core OSE has severe balance problems:

- Demihumans are strictly worse (lower HP, level caps, specific weaknesses).
- Clerics are nearly as good as Fighters (turn undead is overpowered).
- Magic Users are either useless (L1–4) or dominant (L9+); no middle ground.
- Half-Orcs and Half-Elves feel like "D-tier options."

This house rules + advanced class system fixes most of these:

- Demihumans have distinct niches (Drow in darkness, Svirnefblin underground, etc.).
- Clerics are A-tier but not Fighter-tier (clearer hierarchy).
- Magic Users are B-tier early, A- late (investment rewarded, not broken).
- Advanced classes provide playstyle diversity.

---

### Recommendations for Further Refinement

#### 1. **Add a Tier-By-Campaign Table**

| Campaign Type | S Tier | A Tier       | A- Tier           | B+ Tier                         |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Dungeon crawl | —      | Fighter, CL  | Magic User, DW    | Thief, Rng*, Druid*, Acro, HE   |
| Wilderness    | —      | Fighter, CL  | Ranger, Barbarian | Druid, Gnome, Dwarf, HO, HF, HE |
| Underdark     | —      | Drow, DW     | Svirnefblin, Duer | Cleric, Assassin, HO, HF, HE    |
| Intrigue/City | —      | Cleric, HE   | Thief, Bard       | Illusionist, Acrobat, HF        |
| High-Magic    | —      | Paladin, ELF | Magic User, Clr   | Druid, Illusionist, Ranger, HE  |

\*Caveats apply. This helps players align class picks with campaign.

#### 2. **Document Skill Progression Comparison**

Create a table showing Climb/Hear Noise/Move Silently/Pick Pockets progression for all skill-using classes so players can compare at a glance.

#### 3. **Add "Multiclass Synergies" Section**

While outside this system, note which class combinations create strong themes (e.g., Fighter/Paladin, Ranger/Druid).

#### 4. **Clarify Assassination Scaling Boundaries**

Specify that assassination save penalties cap at, e.g., -4 at L17+, to prevent infinite save-killing at extreme levels.

#### 5. **Benchmark Against Actual Play**

Playtest with players; track which classes hit their expected tier during campaigns. Adjust based on data.

---

### Final Verdict: **8/10 — Excellent With Active Curation**

**Strengths:**

- No dominant strategies (✓)
- Clear niche differentiation (✓)
- Respects player agency (✓)
- Internally coherent (✓)
- Better than core OSE (✓)

**Weaknesses:**

- Requires DM communication and active scaling (⚠️)
- Some classes are mathematically weak (intentional, but requires DM mitigation)
- High-level Assassin and Barbarian anti-magic create edge-case balance issues (⚠️)
- Skill progression is scattered across class descriptions (presentation issue)

**Recommendation:** Use this system as the foundation for a house rules document. Add the "Tier-by-Campaign" table, consolidate skill progressions, and you have a solid, defensible balance framework that honors OSR design philosophy while improving on core OSE.

## Downtime Economics & Class Interaction (v1.3.0 Analysis)

### New Systems in v1.3.0

**Philanthropy Rework** (XP conversion + consequence rolls):

- 80% gold → XP conversion (80 gp = 80 XP)
- Threshold bonuses: +1 to consequence rolls at Generous tier, +2 at Legendary
- Grouped 2d6 outcomes with alignment bonuses
- Consequence permanence: one roll per threshold per settlement

**Carousing System** (personal relationships + variable costs):

- No XP gain (contrasts philanthropy)
- Seven venue tiers with dice-based costs (1d8+1 to 10d10+50 gp)
- Tab/debt mechanics for insufficient funds
- Bonus spending: +1 per 50 gp (max +3) to outcome rolls
- 11 individual 2d6 outcomes (2–12+)
- d10 Complications (triggered 2-4) and Opportunities (triggered 10-12+)
- Relationship maintenance: contacts decay after 3 months without carousing

### Class-Specific Economic Impact

#### Fighters & Clerics (High Autonomy → Philanthropy Winners)

**Philanthropy Value:** **A-tier**

- Fighters/Clerics with no magic dependencies convert treasure directly to XP at 80% rate
- No spell research costs or grog maintenance drain gold
- Alignment bonuses (both can reliably target aligned institutions) push threshold rolls toward success
- Clerics especially: donating to temples generates +1 bonus XP rolls AND _Cure Disease_/_Holy Sense_ utility

**Carousing Value:** **B-tier**

- Excess gold after philanthropy converts to social contacts/reputation
- Bonus spending (+3 max) creates predictable cost-benefit: 300 gp (150 base + 150 bonus = +3) for guarantee of +3 outcome
- Clerics benefit from faction relationships (temple patrons, city council members become allies)
- Fighters get mercenary contacts/hiring offers (Opportunities table)

**Economic Profile:** Philanthropy-focused. Carouse when excess gold accumulates, otherwise donate for steady XP.

---

#### Magic Users & Illusionists (High Spell Costs → Philanthropy Losers)

**Philanthropy Value:** **C-tier**

- 80% XP conversion is attractive, BUT...
- Spell research (1,000 gp/level, 2 weeks) competes directly with philanthropy spending
- New spell level-up requires finding/researching spells before gaining them (unlike other classes)
- Example: M-U at L5 needs new 3rd-level spells (3,000 gp research). Donating 3,750 gp for 3,000 XP vs researching for permanent game power? Research wins.
- Alignment bonus is unreliable (Chaotic M-Us don't naturally disrupt status quo; Lawful M-Us aren't trusted by institutions)

**Carousing Value:** **A-tier** (Information > Gold)

- Carousing's Opportunities table provides _Inside Information_ (reveal rival secrets) and _Rare Goods_ (hard-to-find items/scrolls)
- Brothel (3d8+10 gp) and Criminal Den (2d10+5 gp) offer spies/smugglers as contacts → scroll sources
- Bonus spending on Intelligence-based venues (Guild Hall, Gambling Haven, Noble Court) creates networks for spell acquisition
- Carousing relationships decay after 3 months, forcing regular contact maintenance = consistent gold sink for networking

**Economic Profile:** Spell research-focused. Carouse specifically for intelligence/contacts, avoid philanthropy.

---

#### Thieves & Assassins (Skill-Based → Carousing Winners)

**Philanthropy Value:** **D-tier**

- No class alignment synergy (Chaotic gets +1, but Thieves often neutral)
- Treasure from sneaking/assassination is often loot, not gold from services
- No institutional role (temples, guilds, governments don't incentivize Thief donations)
- Alignment bonus requires "disrupting status quo" (assassinating nobles?) = risky

**Carousing Value:** **S-tier**

- Criminal Den (2d10+5 gp) is natural home: thieves, smugglers, black market contacts
- Complications table provides **Theft** and **Hunted** (create adventure hooks) without railroading
- Opportunities table provides **Inside Information**, **Trade Route**, **Secret Society** (all suit spy/rogue archetype)
- Bonus spending in underworld venues scales perfectly: Thief with 500+ gp excess → can afford +3 bonus at Criminal Den
- Relationship maintenance with underworld contacts creates ongoing patron/quest hooks

**Economic Profile:** Carousing-focused, underworld venues. Philanthropy is actively harmful to character concept.

---

#### Drow (Darkness Specialist → New Advantage in Downtime)

**Infravision Rework (v1.3.0):**

- Pitch-darkness only; disabled by light sources
- Heat-blotches + rough silhouettes; no fine details

**Impact on Downtime:**

- **Philanthropy:** Drow can't donate to surface institutions (racial stigma, DM-dependent). -1 to alignment bonuses in lawful societies.
- **Carousing:** Criminal Den, Brothel, Gambling Haven are natural fits. Drow spies/assassins thrive in underworld scene.
- **New Opportunity:** Infravision means Drow can carouse in pitch-dark underworld venues without light sources = unique gameplay (navigate by heat, socialize by touch/smell/voice)

**Verdict:** Drow's downtime is heavily restricted topside, unlocked underground. Carouse in the Underdark; avoid philanthropy in human settlements.

#### Paladins & Rangers (Class-Specific Synergies)

**Philanthropy Value:** **A-tier** (Unique Bonus)

- Paladin alignment requirement (Lawful) guarantees +1 alignment bonus when donating to institutions
- Ranger's class design encourages frontier communities (smaller settlements, wilderness outposts)
- Paladins can build religious authority through philanthropy + alignment bonuses = consequence rolls skew positive

**Carousing Value:** **B-tier**

- Paladins uncomfortable in underworld venues (Criminal Den, Brothel) = forced to noble/military venues (higher costs)
- Rangers fit tavern/alehouse culture (Soldier's Tavern, Common Alehouse) = lower-cost, sustainable carousing
- Ranger relationships with mercenaries/woodsmen (Soldier's Tavern outcomes) create hiring/scouting network

**Economic Profile:** Paladin = philanthropy + noble carousing. Ranger = cheap tavern carousing + wilderness contacts.

### Key Insights

**1. Philanthropy Creates Class Hierarchy, Carousing Creates Narrative Hooks**

- Philanthropy's 80% XP conversion + threshold bonuses = institutional classes (Cleric, Paladin) gain reputation XP faster
- Carousing's concrete contacts = all classes gain adventure seeds (mercenary hire, intel, safe haven)
- A Fighter who always donates plays differently than a Thief who always carouses

**2. Underworld Classes Have an Inverse Economic Profile**

- Thief/Assassin: carousing underground is S-tier, philanthropy is D-tier
- They thrive in Criminal Den/Brothel/Gambling Haven, starve in temples/guilds
- This creates **faction gameplay**: topside NPCs won't hire Thieves, underworld fences will

**3. Gold Flow Creates Playstyle Constraints**

- Magic User must choose: research spells OR donate for XP (both use similar gold)
- Paladin naturally flows toward philanthropy + noble carousing (aligned incentives)
- Thief naturally flows toward carousing in underworld (no virtue-based philanthropy)
- **These aren't bugs—they're features that reinforce character identity**

**4. Relationship Maintenance Creates Recurring Gold Sinks**

- Carousing contacts decay after 3 months
- Carousers must re-spend gold to refresh relationships
- Philanthropists build permanent reputation (thresholds don't reset)
- **Economics reward sustained play patterns**

### Recommendation for v1.3.0

The downtime systems are **excellent at reinforcing class fantasy** without creating mechanical dominance:

- ✓ Philanthropy incentivizes heroic/lawful behavior (Clerics, Paladins, honest Fighters)
- ✓ Carousing incentivizes underworld/social gameplay (Thieves, Bards, street-smart characters)
- ✓ Gold flow creates natural role-play constraints (Paladins uncomfortable in brothels; Thieves unwelcome in temples)
- ✓ Relationship maintenance vs. permanent reputation creates different economic rhythms

**No class is locked out** of either system, but each class has a **natural economic home**. This is elegant design.

**Next step:** Create a **Downtime Quick-Reference** table showing each class's optimal gold allocation for sustainable play.
