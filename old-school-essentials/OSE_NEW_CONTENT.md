The Sage is a dedicated scholar, healer, and inventor who brings intellectual mastery to adventuring. Through careful observation, deep lore, skilled medicine, appraisal of treasures, and clever craftsmanship, the Sage supports the party by revealing hidden truths, directing combat advantages, stabilizing the fallen with expert care, and creating useful tools. Unlike spellcasters, the Sage relies entirely on non-magical knowledge and preparation, making them a vital advisor in exploration, combat, and downtime.

#### Class Features

**Precise Strikes:** The Sage may apply their Intelligence modifier to attack and damage rolls with weapons they are proficient in, representing precise application of anatomical or mechanical knowledge.

**Sage Skills:** The Sage uses a set of percentile skills, progressed in the same manner as the Thief's.

- **At 1st level**: The Sage begins with Lore at 25%, Observation at 20%, Medicine at 20%, Appraisal at 10%, and Craft at 10%. The player distributes 4 increases among these skills (+15% each). No more than two increases may be placed in the same skill at level 1.
- **On New Level**: The Sage gains 2 additional increases per level. No more than one increase may be placed in the same skill per level.
- **Caps**: All skills cap at 85% (reached after 5 increases).

| Skill         | Description (On Successful Roll) |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| **Lore**     | The Sage identifies monsters, items, or terrain features, revealing history, properties, and a minor exploit that provides +1 to one Reaction check, Score check, Skill check, Attack roll, or Saving throw. |
| **Observation** | In combat, the Sage spends a standard action to analyze a foe. On success (checked against the foe's Hit Dice or equivalent rank), a weakness is revealed, granting allies bonus to hit and damage against that target for the duration listed in Keen Observation. |
| **Medicine** | The Sage treats wounds or stabilizes the dying with surgical precision, lowering the damaging effect to Constitution. See Medical Prowess for stabilization details. |
| **Appraisal** | The Sage accurately values gems, art, or gear; detects forgeries or non-magical traps; and has a chance to notice hidden compartments or loot. |
| **Craft**    | The Sage builds or repairs tools and gadgets (for example, an oil slick that creates a -2 Armor Class penalty setup area). |

These skills are class-exclusive Heroic checks; others may attempt related ability checks at penalties.

**Broad Knowledge:** In addition to the percentile skills above, the Sage has access to the general skill system from Rules Cyclopedia (pg. 81–86). The Sage begins with the standard number of blank skill slots available to all characters. However, the Sage gains **additional blank skill slots every 2 levels** (at levels 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.), and these bonus slots may **only** be filled with knowledge-based or "Lore" skills from the Rules Cyclopedia list (or equivalent DM-approved intellectual skills). Examples include:

- Science (various specialties: biology, geology, astronomy, etc.)
- History
- Engineering
- Knowledge (languages, heraldry, mythology, etc.)
- Art (calligraphy, poetry, music theory—non-performance)
- Healing (advanced variants, if not overlapping Medicine percentile)
- Nature (plants, animals—non-combat identification)
- Any other purely intellectual skill approved by the DM (no combat, stealth, or performance skills).

These slots follow all standard RC skill rules: filled on demand during play (with backstory justification), improved to Expert (+2 or equivalent) at level 5 and Master (+5) at level 9 by spending additional slots on the same skill. Bonus slots do not count toward standard character limits and are exclusively for deepening the Sage's scholarly expertise.

This makes the Sage the party's premier repository of specialized knowledge, able to accumulate a broad array of lore skills over time without competing with other classes' general skill access.



**Erudite Sense**
The Sage may concentrate for one turn (10 minutes) on a held item or a 30-foot area. Roll the Lore skill. On success, the Sage gains non-magical information about the subject (history, properties, construction) and a hint toward a minor exploit if applicable.

**Keen Observation**
In combat, the Sage may take a standard action to study an enemy, rolling the Observation skill against the target's Hit Dice or equivalent rank. On success, the Sage reveals a vulnerability, granting the listed benefits to all allies attacking that target. The Sage shares verbal insights freely, allowing allies to apply minor exploits (for example, "strike the joint—flank for -2 Armor Class penalty next turn").

| Level | Uses per Encounter | Targets | Benefits to Allies vs Target(s) |
|-------|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| 1–4   | 1                  | 1 foe   | +1 to attack rolls (duration: 1 round per Sage level) + minor exploit |
| 5–8   | 2                  | Up to 2 foes | +1 to attack rolls and +1 to damage (duration: 2 rounds per Sage level) + minor exploit |
| 9+    | 3                  | A group (up to Sage level in HD total) | +1 to attack rolls and +2 to damage (duration: 3 rounds per Sage level) + major exploit (for example, group-wide -2 Armor Class penalty setup) |

At 9th level, the Sage gains a free passive observation once per turn on any foe they are engaged with or clearly viewing (no action required).

**Medical Prowess**
The Sage performs first aid and stabilization as any character (one turn of post-combat aid or within one minute of injury). When the Sage attempts stabilization on a dying character:

- Roll the Medicine skill percentile.
- On success, the target's Constitution check against death gains a bonus of +1 (+2 at 5th level, +3 at 9th level). The Sage also halves the target's Constitution recovery time and restores 1d3 hit points.
- On failure, standard first aid applies (no bonus to the Constitution check).
This ability may be used once per day per creature and stacks with other healing effects (the Constitution check is still required).

**Research (Downtime)**
While in a settlement with access to libraries or archives, the Sage may spend one week and 100 gp per their level in research. Roll the Lore skill (or an appropriate RC general skill). On success, the Sage uncovers useful secrets, rumors, or maps relevant to the campaign, plus a potential exploit hook.

**Workshop (Downtime)**
With access to basic tools and materials, the Sage may spend one week and 500 gp per their level crafting a gadget or tool. Roll the Craft skill. On success, the item functions as intended (for example, caltrops, smoke vial, or reinforced rope). At 5th level and higher, workshop crafts are reliable (automatic success on standard items).

**Savant (9th Level)**
The Sage becomes a master advisor. Once per encounter, the Sage may rally allies with words of wisdom, granting +1 to saving throws and Morale checks for 1d6 rounds.

The Sage combines the write-up in the Old School Essentials Advanced Player's Tome (or equivalent scholarly archetype) with the changes and additions listed here. The Sage fills a unique role as the party's intellectual anchor—guiding combat through insight, preserving lives through skilled care, accumulating deep specialized knowledge via bonus lore skill slots, and unlocking the world's secrets without recourse to magic.
