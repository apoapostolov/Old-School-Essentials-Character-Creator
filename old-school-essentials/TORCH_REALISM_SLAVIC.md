# Torch Realism: Feudal Slavic Lighting

## Historical Context

In medieval Slavic societies (12th–15th centuries), lighting technology was constrained by geography and available resources. Slavic lands had abundant forests (birch, pine, spruce) but limited access to whale oil or high-quality tallow until trade routes matured. This meant torches remained the primary light source for common folk and adventurers throughout the period.

## Torch Types by Quality & Cost

### Standard Torch (1 sp)

**Materials:** Bundle of 4–6 wooden sticks (birch, pine, or spruce) wrapped tightly with cloth scraps or plant fibers and bound with twine. The bundle is then dipped once or twice in cheap pitch or tar.

**Characteristics:**

- Burns 1d4+4 turns (5–8 turns)
- Produces steady light (30' radius)
- Smells of tar and smoke
- Sputters occasionally in wind or damp conditions
- Ash and pitch residue drips onto clothing and gear

**Historical Accuracy:** This matches archaeological findings of birch-bark and pine torches recovered from Scandinavian and East European sites. Common soldiers and servants used them.

---

### Birch-Bark Torch (2 sp)

**Materials:** Sheets of dried birch bark (preferably from dead birch trees) rolled tightly and bound with birch twine. The bark naturally contains oils and resins, requiring no pitch coating.

**Characteristics:**

- Burns 1d6+3 turns (4–9 turns)
- Produces clean, bright light (40' radius)
- Minimal smoke compared to pitch torches
- Burns with a slight white/amber flame
- Produces white ash (less staining than pitch)
- Works reasonably well in light rain (bark is naturally water-resistant)

**Cost Justification:** Birch bark requires specific harvesting (dead trees only, or careful stripping in spring) and drying time. Slavic craftspeople developed this technique because birch was abundant and birch-bark torches were culturally familiar.

**Historical Accuracy:** Birch-bark torches are documented in Nordic and Slavic archaeological contexts. Baltic and Russian peoples preferred them for long expeditions because they burned more cleanly than pitch torches and provided better light.

### Pine-Resin Torch (4 sp)

**Materials:** Thick wooden core (6–8 inches long) split lengthwise, with the center packed with dried pine resin chunks and wrapped in linen cloth. The resin is harvested from live pine trees (by careful tapping) or collected from dead resin-rich wood.

**Characteristics:**

- Burns 2d4+6 turns (8–14 turns)
- Produces very bright light (50' radius)
- Heavy smoke and pungent aroma (warns creatures of approach)
- Extremely flammable (careless handling can ignite nearby cloth or dry wood)
- Burns hot; will ignite oil, grease, or other combustibles
- Cannot be easily extinguished without full submersion or deliberate crushing
- Weight: 2 cn (heavier than standard torches due to resin content)

**Cost Justification:** Pine resin is difficult to harvest and process safely. Only wealthy merchants, military units, or adventurers with the resources buy them. They are prized for extended cave expeditions where light duration matters more than stealth.

**Historical Accuracy:** Slavic and Northern European peoples used pitch-pine torches (often called "resinous torches") for major expeditions, hunting, and military operations. The Varangian Guard reportedly carried such torches. They were expensive and reserved for critical situations.

### Tallow/Fat Lamp (3 sp)

**Materials:** Ceramic or wooden bowl filled with rendered animal tallow or fat, with a simple wick of plant fiber or twisted straw floating on the surface.

**Characteristics:**

- Burns 3d4 turns (3–12 turns) with fresh tallow
- Produces steady, warm light (30' radius, but lower quality than torches)
- Smells unpleasant (rancid animal fat)
- Must be carried carefully to avoid spilling (requires a holder or careful grip)
- No ash; tallow residue is greasy and sticky
- Can be refueled by adding more tallow
- If tipped, burning tallow can start fires

**Cost Justification:** Tallow is a byproduct of butchering, so it's cheaper per unit of light time, but the lamp vessel adds cost. Useful for long stationary camps but awkward to carry while adventuring.

**Historical Accuracy:** Tallow lamps were common in Slavic households and monasteries. Butchers made tallow as a side business. They were not portable adventure lights, but parties camping in the wilderness might carry one for base camp use.

### Beeswax Candle (10+ sp)

**Materials:** Pure beeswax molded into a candle shape (approximately 4 inches tall). Requires a wick of twisted plant fiber or animal gut.

**Characteristics:**

- Burns 1d4+2 turns per candle (3–6 turns)
- Produces very bright, clean light (35' radius)
- Pleasant smell (slight honey aroma)
- Expensive; only nobility, wealthy merchants, and clergy regularly use them
- Burn cleanly with minimal residue or smoke
- Poor practical choice for dungeon adventuring (too expensive to burn carelessly)

**Cost Justification:** Beeswax is rare and valuable. Beekeeping was a specialized craft. Church and nobility purchased most beeswax candles. Commoners would never burn them for exploration.

**Historical Accuracy:** Beeswax candles were status symbols in medieval Slavic societies. They appear in inventories of rich merchants, monasteries, and noble houses. For adventuring, they are impractical but might be carried as backup light by wealthy parties.

## Slavic Regional Preferences

### Forest-Dwelling Peoples (Northern & Eastern Slavs)

Birch-bark torches were the standard. The abundance of birch and the low cost of production made them ubiquitous. Expeditions into wilderness or forest caves typically used birch-bark torches unless extreme duration was needed (in which case pine-resin torches were purchased at great expense).

### Settled Agricultural Peoples (Central Slavs)

Pitch torches (standard torches) were common, combined with tallow lamps for indoor use. Pine-resin torches were reserved for military campaigns. This reflects more balanced access to forests and livestock.

### Wealthy Merchant Cities (Novgorod, Krakow, etc.)

All types of light sources were available, with trade bringing whale-oil lamps and higher-quality candles. Wealthy adventurers might carry beeswax candles or oil lamps, while poor hireling are outfitted with standard torches.

## Dungeon Implications for OSE Campaigns

### Party Composition Effects Light Economy

- **Poor hireling parties:** Standard torches only (1 sp each)
- **Mixed parties:** Standard torches + 1–2 birch-bark torches as backups
- **Wealthy parties:** Pine-resin torches for extended delves, birch-bark torches for standard exploration
- **Noble-sponsored expeditions:** Oil lamps, beeswax candles, and redundant light sources

### The 1 sp Standard Torch Baseline

The rule assumes standard pitch torches (1d4+4 turns). If a party purchases birch-bark torches (2 sp each) instead, they gain:

- +2 to their torch duration roll (effectively 1d6+3)
- Cleaner light (less atmospheric smoke in dungeon)
- Better performance in damp conditions (10% bonus to avoid extinguishing in water)

### Realistic Resource Depletion

A 6-person party planning a full day of dungeon exploration needs:

- **Standard torches:** 12–18 torches (12–18 sp, roughly 3–5 gp)
- **Birch-bark torches:** 6–9 torches (12–18 sp, roughly 6–9 gp)
- **Pine-resin torches:** 2–3 torches (8–12 sp, roughly 4–6 gp total)

For a full week of cave exploration with supply runs to the Keep, a party burns through 30+ torches, costing roughly 30 gp in consumables. Hiring a torchbearer (1 sp/day = 7 sp/week) becomes economically sensible once a party is spending more than 7 sp on torches per day.

### Lair Ecology & Light

Monsters living in the Caves of Chaos understand torch light. They may:

- **Avoid torch-lit areas** (if they have infravision and prefer darkness)
- **Extinguish torches** during combat (goblins throwing water, bugbears smashing held torches)
- **Set ambushes in darkness** beyond torch range (while they have infravision)
- **Flee deeper** when torches approach their lair entrance

This means light is not just a personal resource—it's a tactical tool that monsters respond to intelligently.

## Implementation Notes

For your OSE Keep on the Borderlands campaign, I recommend:

1. **Standard 1 sp torch as the baseline** (1d4+4 turns). This matches the house rule already written.

2. **Birch-bark torches available at the Keep tavern** (2 sp each). Let wealthy parties purchase better light. The extra cost is justified by better duration and damp-condition performance.

3. **Pine-resin torches are special order** (4 sp, 1–2 week wait, or found in lair treasures). They're not a casual purchase—they're expedition equipment.

4. **Tallow lamps available for camp use** (3 sp + ceramic bowl, 5 sp). Useful for base camps at the Keep or in wilderness, but not practical for active dungeon crawling.

5. **Beeswax candles are treasure, not supplies.** A well-funded party might carry 1–2 as backup, but they're too expensive to burn regularly.

This creates a realistic economy where light is a meaningful resource, parties must choose between cheap (risky) and expensive (safer, longer) options, and hiring specialists (torchbearers) becomes strategically sound rather than just flavor.
