## Downtime Systems for B2 Keep on the Borderlands

### Priority 1: Core Systems

- [ ] **Faction Reputation System**

  - Track standing with Keep factions (Castellan's men, Church, Guild, Guards)
  - Track standing with Caves chaos factions
  - Create benefits/penalties for reputation levels
  - Integrate with existing carousing venues (drinking with guards alienates smugglers, etc.)
  - Define how reputation affects philanthropy outcomes
  - Create mechanics for reputation decay and recovery

- [ ] **Rest & Recovery System**

  - Injuries and exhaustion from delving
  - Downtime healing rules with time/gold costs
  - Penalties for pushing too hard between expeditions
  - Benefits for proper rest between delves
  - Integrate with existing racial HD and healing mechanics

- [ ] **Training & Mentorship System**
  - NPCs at the Keep who can train characters between delves
  - Tie to leveling requirements or bonus abilities
  - Skill acquisition from retired adventurers
  - Gold-for-time mechanics consistent with existing systems
  - Create narrative hooks for mentor relationships

### Priority 2: Supporting Systems

- [ ] **Research & Crafting System**

  - Magic item research and identification
  - Spell creation and scroll transcription for casters
  - Divine item consecration for Clerics
  - Mundane crafting for repairs and improvements
  - Gold-for-time mechanics, consistent with existing downtime systems

- [ ] **Mercenary Management System**
  - Hiring retainers between delves
  - Loyalty mechanics and morale
  - Wages, equipment, and upkeep costs
  - What hirelings do during character downtime
  - Integration with existing Grog rules

### Priority 3: Optional Expansion

- [ ] **Rumor Gathering System**

  - Formalize how players learn about the Caves
  - Costs for information (gold, favors, time)
  - Reliability mechanics (true/false/partial information)
  - False leads and red herrings
  - Natural integration with carousing system

- [ ] **Domain Management Lite**

  - The Keep is struggling—let characters invest
  - Defensive upgrades and fortifications
  - Economic improvements
  - Long-term investment benefits
  - Ties to faction reputation

- [ ] **Wilderness Exploration Procedures**
  - Structured rules for discovering locations beyond the Caves
  - Hex-crawling mechanics
  - Random encounter tables
  - Weather and travel time
  - Supply management

## Design Principles to Maintain

- **Gold-for-mechanical-benefit** (like philanthropy's 80% XP conversion)
- **Dice-based outcomes** (like carousing's venue costs)
- **Concrete consequences, not vague obligations** (no "schemes" players can ignore)
- **Social/factional gameplay** emphasis
- **Downtime creates adventure hooks** and player investment
- **Consistent with OSE B/X philosophy** (streamlined, purposeful)

## Notes

- Faction reputation would integrate seamlessly with existing carousing system
- All systems should create meaningful choices without bogging down play
- Keep the Keep as the central hub for all downtime activities
- Maintain tension between spending gold on XP vs. other benefits
