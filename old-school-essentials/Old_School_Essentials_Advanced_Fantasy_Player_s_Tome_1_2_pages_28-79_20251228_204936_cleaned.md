## Character Classes

### Acrobat

Requirements: None
Prime requisite: DEX
Hit Dice: 1d4
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, no shields
Weapons: Missile weapons, dagger, sword, short sword, pole arm, spear, staff
Languages: Alignment, Common

Acrobats are trained in skills of balance, gymnastics, and stealth. They often work in conjunction with thieves and may belong to a Thieves’ Guild.

Adjust ability scores: During character creation, acrobats may not lower STR.

Encumbrance: Evasion, falling, jumping, and tightrope walking cannot be performed if encumbrance reduces the acrobat’s movement rate to less than 90’ (30’) (see Encumbrance, p215).

### Acrobat Skills

Acrobats can use the following skills with the chance of success shown opposite.

- Climb sheer surfaces (CS): A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the acrobat falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.

- Falling (FA): When able to tumble, acrobats suffer no damage from the first 10’ of any fall. Damage due to falling from a greater height is reduced by the listed percentage (rounding fractions down).

- Hide in shadows (HS): The acrobat must be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.

### Combat

Acrobats cannot wear armour bulkier than leather and cannot use shields. They are able to use all missile weapons. Their use of melee weapons is restricted to light blades and staff weapons.

### Evasion

When retreating from melee, an acrobat’s ability to tumble negates the opponent’s usual +2 bonus to hit (see p234).

### Jumping

With a 20’ run-up, an acrobat can jump across a 10’ wide pit or chasm (or 20’ wide when aided by the use of a pole). Also when using a pole, an acrobat can jump over a 10’ high wall or onto a 10’ high ledge. Suitable poles for jumping include: 10’ poles, pole arms, spears, staves.

### Tumbling Attack

Using the falling or jumping abilities, an acrobat can make a tumbling melee attack. The attack inflicts double damage if successful. Against an unaware opponent, the acrobat also gains a +4 bonus to hit.

## After Reaching 9th Level

An acrobat can establish a training school, attracting 2d6 apprentices of 1st level. The apprentices will serve the character with some reliability; however, should any be arrested or killed, the character will not be able to attract apprentices to replace them. A successful acrobat burglar might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild.

## Rolling Skill Checks

All skills except falling are rolled on d%, with a result of less than or equal to the listed percentage indicating success.

## Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hide in shadows and move silently on the player’s behalf, as the acrobat always believes the attempt to be successful. If the roll fails, the referee knows that the acrobat has been noticed and should determine enemies' actions appropriately.

## Assassin

Requirements: None
Prime requisite: DEX
Hit Dice: 1d4
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common

Assassins are adventurers who specialise in the arts of infiltration and killing by stealth. They sometimes form guilds whereby their illicit services may be hired.

Alignment: Assassins may not be lawful.

Adjust ability scores: During character creation, assassins may not lower STR.

### Assassin Skills

Assassins can use the following skills with the chance of success shown opposite:

- **Assassination (AS)**: When attacking an unaware humanoid from behind, an assassin gains a +4 bonus to hit. If the attack succeeds, the victim must save versus death with a penalty dependent on the assassin’s level (noted in the table opposite). If the save fails, the victim is instantly killed, otherwise the assassin’s attack inflicts normal damage.

- **Climb sheer surfaces (CS)**: A roll is required for each 100' to be climbed. If the roll fails, the assassin falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.

- **Hear noise (HN)**: In a quiet environment (e.g. not in combat), an assassin may attempt to listen at a door or to hear the sounds of something (e.g. a wanderer-monster) approaching.

- **Hide in shadows (HS)**: Requires the assassin to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.

- **Move silently (MS)**: An assassin may attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.

### Combat

Assassins cannot wear armour bulkier than leather but may use shields. They can use all types of weapons.

### Disguise

Characters of any class may don disguises, but assassins are masters of the art—able to create disguises that pass even close scrutiny.

- **Chance of detection**: Everyone the assassin meets has a 2% chance of spotting the disguise. This roll is repeated once every subsequent day of meeting.

- **Posing as another class, race, or sex**: Increases the chance of being detected by 2% per change.

- **Height and weight**: A disguise may alter height (up to 3” shorter or 5” taller) or weight (slightly thinner, much bulkier).

### Hirelings

Assassins of 1st–3rd level may not employ retainers, mercenaries, or specialists. From 4th level, an assassin may hire other assassins of lower level. From 8th level, an assassin may hire thieves, and from 12th level, any type of character.

### Poison

Victims of a poisoning by an assassin (see *Poison*, p98) suffer a –2 penalty to the saving throw.

### After Reaching 12th Level

An assassin may attempt to take over an existing guild of assassins or thieves by killing the old guild-master. This may be achieved by any means (e.g. poisoning, assassination, duel). If successful, the character can maintain a guild of 7d4 members. 75% of the existing members will leave, but new members (typically 1 level assassins) will arrive over time.

## Rolling Skill Checks

Hear noise: Is rolled on 1d6. If the roll is within the listed range of numbers, the skill succeeds.

Assassination: Is not rolled as a check.

Other skills: Are rolled on d%, with a result of less than or equal to the listed percentage indicating success.

## Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for HN, HS, and MS on the player’s behalf, as the assassin does not immediately know if the attempt was successful. If an HS or MS roll fails, the referee knows that the assassin has been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

## Barbarian

Requirements: Minimum DEX 9
Prime requisite: CON and STR
Hit Dice: 1d8
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, chainmail, shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common

Barbarians are tribal warriors from wild lands. They are formidable fighters with many useful survival skills but have a deep mistrust of the arcane.

Prime requisites: A barbarian with at least 13 in one prime requisite gains a 5% bonus to experience. If both STR and CON are 16 or higher, the barbarian gets a +10% bonus.

Literacy: A 1st level barbarian cannot read or write, irrespective of INT score.

### Agile Fighting

Upon reaching 4th level, a barbarian gains a +1 AC bonus. This increases to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 8th level, and +4 at 10th level.

### Barbarian Skills

In the wilderness, barbarians can use the following skills with the chance of success shown opposite:

- **Climb sheer surfaces (CS)**: Only applies to natural surfaces (e.g. tree trunks, cliff faces). A skill roll is required for each 100’ height to be climbed. Failure indicates that the barbarian falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.
- **Hide in undergrowth (HD)**: Requires the barbarian to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.
- **Move silently (MS)**: A barbarian may attempt to sneak past enemies.

### Combat

Barbarians can use all types of weapons and can use leather armour, chainmail, and shields.

### Cure Poison

In the wilderness, a barbarian can gather herbs to concoct an antidote to natural poisons. This takes one turn per character to be cured. Each subject may make a second save versus poison to end the effects.

### Fear of Magic

Barbarians are mistrustful of magic and will refuse to knowingly use or come under the influence of spells or magic items. Barbarians will accept divine magic associated with their tribal religion.

### Foraging and Hunting

A party with a barbarian succeeds at foraging with a 2-in-6 chance and finds prey when hunting with a 5-in-6 chance (see Wilderness Adventuring, p224).

### Strike Invulnerable Monsters

A barbarian of 4th level or higher is able to hit monsters that can normally only be harmed by magic.

### After Reaching 8th Level

A barbarian can call upon their native people to form a great horde of warriors, numbering 250 per level above 7th. The warriors are 1st level fighters with basic combat gear and may be mounted if customary in their culture. A horde can only be mustered for a specific purpose (e.g. attacking an enemy city, rescuing hostages, etc.). Once the purpose is achieved or abandoned, the horde disbands. Mustering a horde takes one week, and it remains for one week per level of the barbarian.

## Rolling Skill Checks

All skills are rolled on d%, with a result of less than or equal to the listed percentage indicating success.

## Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hiding and moving silently on the player’s behalf, as the barbarian always believes the attempt to be successful. If the roll fails, the referee knows that the barbarian has been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

## Bard

Requirements: Minimum DEX 9, minimum INT 9
Prime requisite: CHA
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Leather, chainmail, no shields
Weapons: Missile weapons, one-handed melee weapons
Languages: Alignment, Common

Bards are members of a sect of minstrels and warrior poets associated with the druids. Like druids, bards worship the force of nature and the myriad deities that personify it. Their strengths lie in their deep knowledge of myth and legend, the magic that they wield on behalf of their gods, and the enchanting power of their music.

### Anti-Charm

While the bard plays music and sings, allies within 30’ are immune to song-based magical effects and the beguiling powers of sylvan creatures or fairies. Allies already under the effect of such magic may make another saving throw with a +4 bonus.

### Combat

Bards can use leather armour or chainmail but do not have the training required to use plate mail or shields. They can use all missile weapons and all one-handed melee weapons.

### Divine Magic

See Magic, p122 for full details on divine magic.

Deity disfavor: Bards must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment and religion. Bards who fall from favour with their deity may incur penalties.

Spell casting: Once a bard has proven their faith (from 2nd level), the character may pray to receive spells. The power and number of spells available to a bard are determined by experience level. The list of spells available to bards is found on p129 (bards have the same spell selection as druids).

Using magic items: As spell casters, bards can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They may also use any items that only druids can use.

### Enchantment

By playing music and singing, the bard can fascinate subjects in a 30’ radius. This ability does not function in combat.

Number of subjects: Up to 2HD of creatures per level of the bard are affected. The bard may choose to target a specific individual or a group (in which case, the affected individuals are determined randomly).

Types of subjects: At 1st level, the bard can fascinate persons. At 4th level, animals may also be affected. At 7th level, monsters may be affected.

Effect: Each subject must save versus spells or be fascinated, as follows:

- **Rapt**: Fascinated subjects’ attention is fully bent on the bard’s performance, as long as it continues.
- **Follow**: The bard may walk while playing. Fascinated subjects will follow.
- **Interruptions**: If the performance is interrupted (e.g. by loud noise or violence), the fascination ends immediately.

* Modifiers from CON no longer apply.

### Charming Fascinated Subjects

If the bard performs for at least one turn and the performance ends without interruption, fascinated subjects may be placed under a deeper charm. Each subject must make another save versus spells (with a +2 bonus) or be charmed for one turn per level of the bard:

- *Friendship:* Charmed subjects regard the bard as a trusted friend and ally and will come to the bard’s defense.

- *Commands:* If they share a language, charmed subjects will obey the bard’s commands.

- *Alignment:* Commands that contradict the charmed creature's nature or alignment may be ignored.

- *Suicidal commands:* Charmed subjects never obey suicidal or obviously harmful orders.

### Languages

Bards learn new languages as they advance in level. At every even numbered level above 3rd (i.e. 4th, 6th, 8th, etc.), the player may choose an additional language. Bards may learn the secret tongue of druids in this way (see *Druid*, p40).

### Lore

From 2nd level, a bard has a 2-in-6 chance of knowing lore pertaining to monsters, magic items, or heroes of folklore or legend. This ability may be used to identify the nature and powers of magic items.

### After Reaching 11th Level

A bard can establish a manor. 2d6 apprentice bards of 1st level will come to study under the character.

## Cleric

**Requirements:** None

**Prime requisite:** WIS

**Hit Dice:** 1d6

**Maximum level:** 14

**Armour:** Any, including shields

**Weapons:** Any blunt weapons

**Languages:** Alignment, Common

Clerics are adventurers who have sworn to serve a deity. They are trained for battle and channel the power of their deity.

### Combat

Clerics can use all types of armour. Strict holy doctrine prevents clerics’ use of weapons that have a sharp, cutting edge or stabbing point. They may use the following weapons: club, mace, sling, staff, war hammer.

### Divine Magic

See Magic, p122 for full details on divine magic.

**Holy symbol:** A cleric must carry a holy symbol (see Equipment, p94).

**Deity disfavour:** Clerics must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment, clergy, and religion. Clerics who fall from favour with their deity may incur penalties.

**Magical research:** A cleric of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to create new spells or other magical effects associated with their deity. When a cleric reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items.

### Spell casting

Once a cleric has proven their faith (from 2nd level), the character may pray to receive spells. The power and number of spells available to a cleric are determined by the character’s experience level. The list of spells available to clerics is found on p128.

**Using magic items:** As spell casters, clerics can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by divine spell casters (e.g. some magic staves).

### Turning the Undead

Clerics can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters encountered. To turn the undead, the player rolls 2d6. The referee then consults the table opposite, comparing the roll against the HD of the type of undead monsters targeted.

#### Successful Turning

If the turning attempt succeeds, the player must roll 2d6 again to determine the number of HD affected (turned or destroyed).

- **Turned undead:** Will leave the area, if possible, and will not harm or make contact with the cleric.

- **Destroyed undead (result of D):** Are instantly and permanently annihilated.

- **Excess:** Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a monster are wasted.

- **Minimum effect:** At least one undead monster will always be affected on a successful turning.

- **Mixed groups:** If turn undead is used against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.

## Turning Table Results

- : The turning fails.

Number: If the 2d6 turning roll is higher or equal, the turning attempt succeeds.

- T: The turning succeeds.

- D: The turning succeeds; the monsters are destroyed, not simply caused to flee.

## After Reaching 9th Level

A cleric may establish or build a stronghold. So long as the cleric is currently in favour with their god, a stronghold may be bought or built at half the normal price, due to divine intervention.

Once a stronghold is established, the cleric will attract followers (5d6 × 10 fighters of level 1–2). These troops are completely devoted to the cleric, never checking morale. The referee decides which proportions of followers are 1st and 2nd level and which are bowmen, infantry, etc.

## After Reaching 9th Level

A drow may establish a subterranean stronghold or temple. If the drow is in favour with their deity, the complex may be bought or built at half the normal price due to the direct intervention of the deity.

Once a stronghold or temple is established, the drow will attract followers (5d6 × 10 non-spell casting drow of 1st or 2nd level).

## Druid

### Requirements:
None

### Prime requisite:
WIS

### Hit Dice:
1d6

### Maximum level:
14

### Armour:
Leather, wooden shields

### Weapons:
Club, dagger, sling, spear, staff

### Languages:
Alignment, Common

Druids are priests of nature, protecting wild lands from the encroachment of “civilised” Law and the corrupting touch of Chaos. They worship the force of nature itself, personified in the form of various nature deities.

### Alignment:
Druids regard the ways of the natural world as the ideal state of things. They see the concepts of Law and Chaos as extremes that are both equally against nature. Thus, druids must be neutral in alignment.

### Charm Immunity
Druids of 7th level and above are immune to the charms of fairies and Sylvan creatures (e.g. dryads, nixies).

### Combat
The holy doctrine of the druids stipulates that they may not use metal armour or shields (wooden shields may be purchased at the normal price). Their choice of weapons is limited to clubs, daggers, slings, spears, and staves.

### Divine Magic
See Magic, p122 for full details on divine magic.

#### Holy symbol:
A druid must carry a holy symbol: a sprig of mistletoe which the character must harvest.

### Deity disfavour:
Druids must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment and religion. Druids who fall from favour with their deity may incur penalties.

### Magical research:
A druid of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to create new spells or other magical effects associated with their deity. When a druid reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items.

### Spell casting:
A druid may pray to receive spells from nature. The power and number of spells available to a druid are determined by the character’s experience level. The list of spells available to druids is found on p129.

### Using magic items:
As spell casters, druids can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by divine spell casters (e.g. some staves). Druids may not use magical books or tomes.

### Energy Resistance
Druids gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against electricity (lightning) and fire.

### Identification
Druids can identify all plants and animals and can discern pure water.

### Languages
Druids speak a secret tongue known only to their sect. At each level above 2nd, a druid also learns to speak a language used by creatures of Sylvan forests (e.g. dryads, green dragons, pixies, treants).

### Pass Without Trace
From 3rd level, a druid can pass through natural environments without leaving any tracks. The character is also able to move through overgrown areas at normal speed and without impediment.

* Modifiers from CON no longer apply.

## Path-Finding

A party with a druid has only a 1-in-6 chance of getting lost in woodlands. See [Wilderness Adventuring](https://example.com) for more details.

## Shape Change

At 7th level, a druid gains the power to change into the form of a reptile, bird, and mammal (once per day each). The animal may be of any size up to around twice the bulk of the druid’s normal form. If a druid has lost hit points, they regain 1d4 hit points per level upon changing into an animal. All equipment carried by the druid is absorbed into the animal form and reappears when the druid changes back.

## Reaching 12th Level and Above

There can only be nine druids of 12th level. When a druid has enough experience to reach 12th level, they must challenge an existing 12th level druid. The character only advances to 12th level if the other druid is defeated. Such challenges may take any form that is agreed by both parties, including combat (which need not be fatal). Likewise, there can only be three druids of 13th level and a single druid (known as the arch-druid) of 14th level.

Druids who attain 12th level or above may build a stronghold integrated into a natural setting.

## Duergar

### Demihuman Class

**Requirements:** Minimum CON 9, minimum INT 9
**Prime requisite:** STR
**Hit Dice:** 1d6
**Maximum level:** 10
**Armour:** Any, including shields
**Weapons:** Small or normal sized
**Languages:** Alignment, Common, Deepcommon, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Goblin, Kobold

Duergars (grey dwarves) are scrawny, bearded demihumans with grey skin and hair and gnarled faces. They are around 4' tall, about 120 pounds, and have lifespans of up to 500 years. Duergars dwell in strongholds and cities deep underground. They are renowned for their greed for precious metals and stones and for their xenophobia toward other races. Duergars have a naturally strong constitution and are highly resistant to magic.

### Combat

Duergars can use all types of armour. Due to their short height, they can only use small or normal sized weapons. They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

### Detect Construction Tricks

As expert miners, duergars have a 2-in-6 chance of being able to detect new construction, sliding walls, or sloping passages when searching.

### Detect Room Traps

Due to their expertise with construction, duergars have a 2-in-6 chance of detecting non-magical room traps when searching (see Dungeon Adventuring, p222).

### Infravision

Duergars have infravision to 90' (see Darkness, p220).

### Light Sensitivity

When in bright light (daylight, continual light), duergars suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a -1 penalty to AC.

### Listening at Doors

Duergars have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see Dungeon Adventuring, p222).

### Mental Powers

Once per day per level, a duergar may activate one of the following mental powers:

- **Enlargement:** The duergar’s body, clothing, and armour (but not other equipment) double in size for 1d4 rounds. While enlarged, the duergar’s melee attacks inflict double damage.

- **Invisibility:** The duergar disappears from the sight of one or more creatures (selected when the power is activated) for one turn. Up to 1HD of creatures per level of the duergar are affected. In combat, affected creatures may attack the duergar with a -4 penalty after the first round.

- **Shrinking:** The duergar and all equipment shrinks to 6" tall for up to one turn per level. While shrunk, the duergar can slip through narrow spaces and, when remaining motionless, has a 90% chance of going unnoticed. A shrunk duergar cannot harm creatures larger than 1' tall.

- **Heat:** A creature or object within sight is subjected to a scorching heat. Paper or cloth ignite, liquids boil, and metals glow. The heat lasts for one round per level of the duergar. Applied to flesh or to metal in contact with a creature (e.g. armour), the heat inflicts 1d4 damage per round.

## Duergar Level Progression

| Level | XP     | HD  | THAC0 | Saving Throws        | D | W | P | B | S |
|-------|--------|-----|-------|---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1     | 0      | 1d6 | 19 [0]| 8                   | 9 | 10| 13| 12|   |

* Modifiers from CON no longer apply.

## Activating Mental Powers

A duergar must spend a round concentrating in order to activate a mental power. While concentrating, the duergar may not move, attack, or perform any other actions.

In combat: Like spell casting, activating a mental power can be disrupted in combat (see Spell Casting under Combat, p234). The player must declare the use of a mental power before initiative is rolled.

## Stealth

Underground, duergars have a 3-in-6 chance of moving silently.

## After Reaching 9th Level

A duergar has the option of creating an underground stronghold that will attract duergars from far and wide. Duergars usually live in clans, so duergars of the character’s clan will be attracted to live under their roof. Duergars from other clans will generally be friendly and may collaborate in times of war or disaster.

A duergar ruler may only hire duergar mercenaries. Specialists and retainers of any race may be hired.

## Elf

### Demihuman Class

**Requirements**: Minimum INT 9
**Prime requisite**: INT and STR
**Hit Dice**: 1d6
**Maximum level**: 10
**Armour**: Any, including shields
**Weapons**: Any
**Languages**: Alignment, Common, Elvish, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, Orcish

Elves are slender, fey demihumans with pointed ears. They typically weigh about 120 pounds and are between 5 and 5½ feet tall. Elves are seldom met in human settlements, preferring to feast and make merry in the woods. If crossed, they are dangerous enemies, as they are masters of both sword and spell. Elves are fascinated by spells and beautifully constructed magic items and love to collect both.

**Prime requisites**: An elf with at least 13 INT and STR gains a 5% bonus to experience. An elf with an INT of at least 16 and a STR of at least 13 receives a +10% XP bonus.

### Arcane Magic

See [Magic](p122) for full details on arcane magic.

**Magical research**: An elf of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When an elf reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items.

### Spell casting

Elves carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The level progression table (opposite) shows both the number of spells in the elf’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st level elf has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to elves is found on p131 (elves have the same spell selection as magic-users).

### Using magic items

As spell casters, elves are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands).

### Combat

Elves can use all types of weapons and armour.

### Detect Secret Doors

Elves have keen eyes that allow them, when actively searching, to detect hidden and secret doors with a 2-in-6 chance (see [Dungeon Adventuring](p222)).

### Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis

Elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis that ghouls can inflict.

### Infravision

Elves have infravision to 60’ (see [Darkness](p220)).

### Listening at Doors

Elves have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see [Dungeon Adventuring](p222)).

*Modifiers from CON no longer apply.

D: Death / poison; W: Wands; P: Paralysis / petrify; B: Breath attacks; S: Spells / rods / staves.

## After Reaching 9th Level

An elf may construct a stronghold in the depths of the forest, blending in with the natural environment of a site of great beauty, for example: in the treetops, beside a serene valley, or hidden behind a waterfall. Whatever material it is made of, the construction costs as much as similar work in stone, due to the exquisite quality of craftsmanship involved.

Forest animals within a 5 mile radius of the completed stronghold will become friends with the elves. They may warn of intruders, carry messages and news, and so on. In exchange for this friendship, the elf must protect the animals from harm.

An elf ruler may only hire elven mercenaries. Specialists and retainers of any race may be hired.

## Fighter

## Gnome

### Demihuman Class

**Requirements:** Minimum CON 9
**Prime requisite:** DEX and INT
**Hit Dice:** 1d4
**Maximum level:** 8
**Armour:** Leather, shields
**Weapons:** Any appropriate to size
**Languages:** Alignment, Common, Gnomish, Dwarvish, Kobold, the secret language of burrowing mammals

Gnomes are a race of short demihumans with long noses and beards. They are cousins of the dwarves and the two races are on friendly terms. Gnomes prefer to dwell in underground complexes in forests or foothills. They love mining, precious stones, and machinery—from miniature marvels of clockwork to great construction engines. Gnomes are also famed for their penchant for pointy, red, felt hats. Gnomes are typically around 3½' tall and weigh around 100 pounds.

**Prime requisites:** A gnome with at least 13 DEX and INT gains a 5% bonus to experience. A gnome with at least 13 DEX and at least 16 INT gains a 10% bonus.

### Arcane Magic

See [Magic](p122) for full details on arcane magic.

**Magical research:** A gnome of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When a gnome reaches 8th level, they are also able to create magic items.

**Spell casting:** Gnomes carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The level progression table (opposite) shows both the number of spells in the gnome’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st level gnome has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to gnomes is found on p130 (gnomes have the same spell selection as illusionists).

**Using magic items:** As spell casters, gnomes are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands).

### Combat

Gnomes can use leather armour and shields. Armour must be tailored to gnomes’ small size. Similarly, they can use any weapon appropriate to their stature (as determined by the referee). They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

### Defensive Bonus

Due to their small size, gnomes gain a +2 bonus to Armour Class when attacked by large opponents (greater than human-sized).

## Detect Construction Tricks

As expert tunnellers, gnomes have a 2-in-6 chance of being able to detect new construction, sliding walls, or sloping passages when searching.

## Hiding

Gnomes have an uncanny ability to disappear from sight:

- In woodland cover, a gnome can hide with a 90% chance of success.
- In dungeons, a gnome can hide in shadows or behind other forms of cover. The chance of success is 2-in-6. Hiding requires the gnome to be motionless.

## Infravision

Gnomes have infravision to 90’ (see *Darkness*, p.220).

## Listening at Doors

Gnomes have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see *Dungeon Adventuring*, p.222).

## Speak with Burrowing Mammals

Gnomes often keep burrowing mammals such as badgers and moles as pets. They know the secret language of such creatures.

## After Reaching 8th Level

A gnome has the option of creating an underground stronghold that will attract gnomes from far and wide.

Because of gnomes’ connection with burrowing mammals, all such creatures within 5 miles of the stronghold will become friends with the gnomes. They may warn of intruders, carry messages and news, and so on. In exchange for this friendship, the gnome must protect the animals from harm.

Gnome rulers can hire members of other races in the capacity of retainers or specialists, but only soldiers of gnomish stock may be hired.

## Half-Elf

**Prime requisite:** INT and STR
**Hit Dice:** 1d6
**Maximum level:** 12
**Armour:** Any, including shields

Half-elves are the rare offspring of elves and humans. Physically, they tend to combine the best features of their parents, having the innate beauty of elves and the robust physique of humans. They are human-like in stature but always have a feature that marks their elven heritage (e.g. pointed ears or unusually bright eyes). Half-elves are skilled fighters and dabble with magic, though they lack their elvish parents’ mastery of the arcane.

**Prime requisites:** A half-elf with at least 13 INT and STR gains a 5% bonus to experience. A half-elf with a score of 16 or higher in one prime requisite, and a 13 or higher in the other gains a 10% bonus.

### Arcane Magic

See [Magic](p122) for full details on arcane magic.

**Spell casting:** From 2nd level, half-elves gain the ability to cast arcane spells, owning a spell book in which the magical formulae for the spells they know are recorded. The level progression table (opposite) shows both the number of spells in the half-elf’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 2nd level half-elf has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to half-elves is found on p131 (half-elves have the same spell selection as magic-users).

**Using magic items:** As spell casters, half-elves are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands).

### Combat

Half-elves can use all types of weapons and armour.

### Detect Secret Doors

When searching for secret doors, half-elves have a 2-in-6 chance of success (see Dungeon Adventuring, p222).

### Infravision

Half-elves have infravision to 60’ (see Darkness, p220).

### After Reaching 9th Level

A half-elf may strive to become a leader among humans or among elves, constructing a stronghold either in the name of a human liege or in the deep forests of the elves.

#### Human Stronghold

The half-elf may build a castle or stronghold and control the surrounding lands. The character may be granted a title such as Baron or Baroness. The land under the half-elf’s control is then known as a Barony.

#### Elven Stronghold

The half-elf may construct a stronghold in the depths of the forest, blending in with the natural environment of a site of great beauty, for example: in the treetops, beside a serene valley, or hidden behind a waterfall. Whatever material it is made of, the construction costs as much as similar work in stone due to the exquisite quality of craftsmanship involved.

Once the construction is complete, elves will come to live under the rule of the character. Forest animals within a 5 mile radius of the completed stronghold will become friends with the elves. They may warn of intruders, carry messages and news, and so on. In exchange for this friendship, the half-elf must protect the animals from harm.

The ruler of an elven stronghold may only hire elven mercenaries. Specialists and retainers of any race may be hired.

S: Spells / rods / staves.

## Initiative Bonus (Optional Rule)

If using the optional rule for individual initiative (see Combat, p234), halflings get a bonus of +1 to initiative rolls.

## Listening at Doors

Halflings have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see Dungeon Adventuring, p222).

## Missile Attack Bonus

Halflings’ keen coordination grants them a +1 bonus to attack rolls with all missile weapons.

## Stronghold

Any time a halfling wishes (and has sufficient money), they may build a stronghold, which will form the basis of a new community of halflings. Halfling communities—known as Shires—are typically located in gentle countryside of little rivers and rolling hills. The leader of the community is called the Sheriff.

## Half-Orc

### Demihuman Class

**Requirements:** None

**Prime requisite:** DEX and STR

**Hit Dice:** 1d6

**Maximum level:** 8

**Armour:** Leather, chainmail, shields

**Weapons:** Any

**Languages:** Alignment, Common, Orcish

Half-orcs are the rare offspring of orcs and humans. They are human-like in stature and appearance, but usually have at least one feature that marks their orcish heritage (e.g. fangs or a pig-like snout). Due to the common animosity between orcs and humans, half-orcs are typically outcasts from both their parent cultures, living on the fringes of society and making a living by whatever means they can. Half-orc adventurers are capable combatants and have some skill as thieves.

**Prime requisites:** A half-orc with at least 13 DEX and STR gains a 5% bonus to experience. A half-orc with at least 16 DEX and STR gains a 10% bonus.

### Back-Stab

When attacking an unaware opponent from behind, a half-orc receives a +4 bonus to hit and doubles any damage dealt.

### Combat

Half-orcs can use all types of weapons and can use leather armour, chainmail, and shields.

### Infravision

Half-orcs have infravision to 60' (see Darkness, p220).

### Retainers

Half-orcs often have difficulty gaining the trust of humans and demihumans, due to orcs’ chaotic tendencies. Retainers in a half-orc’s employ have their loyalty score reduced by one. (This does not apply to retainers who are also half-orcs.)

### Thieving Skills

Half-orcs can use the following skills, with the chance of success shown opposite:

- **Hide in shadows (HS):** Requires the half-orc to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.

- **Move silently (MS):** A half-orc may attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.

- **Pick pockets (PP):** If the victim is above 5th level, the half-orc’s roll is penalised by 5% for every level above 5th. A roll of more than twice the percentage required for success means that the attempted theft is noticed. The referee should determine the reaction of the victim (possibly using the reaction table under Encounters, p228).

### After Reaching 8th Level

A half-orc can establish a bandit stronghold, attracting 2d6 apprentices—1st level fighters, thieves, or half-orcs. These apprentices will serve the character with some reliability; however, should any be arrested or killed, the PC will not be able to attract apprentices to replace them. A successful half-orc might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild.

## Half-Orc Level Progression

| 7     | 45 | 55 | 55 |
| 8     | 55 | 65 | 65 |

## Rolling Skill Checks

All skills are rolled on d%, with a result of less than or equal to the listed percentage indicating success.

## Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hide in shadows and move silently on the player’s behalf, as the half-orc always believes the attempt to be successful. If the roll fails, the referee knows that the half-orc has been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.

## ILLUSIONIST

### Requirements:

Minimum DEX 9
Prime requisite: INT
Hit Dice: 1d4
Maximum level: 14
Armour: None
Weapons: Dagger, staff (optional)
Languages: Alignment, Common

Illusionists are adventurers who study the arcane arts of illusion and deception. Through this study, they have learned to cast magic spells.

### Arcane Magic

See Magic, p122 for full details on arcane magic.

Magical research: An illusionist of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When an illusionist reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items. Researched spells, effects, and magic items must be within the scope of the illusionist class, as judged by the referee.

Spell casting: Illusionists carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The level progression table (opposite) shows both the number of spells in the illusionist’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st level illusionist has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to illusionists is found on p130.

### Using magic items

As spell casters, illusionists are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands). They are, however, not able to use magic items with effects that cause direct damage (e.g. a wand that shoots fireballs).

### Combat

Illusionists can only use daggers and are unable to use shields or wear any kind of armour. This makes them very vulnerable in combat.

### Illusionists and Staves (Optional Rule)

Optionally, illusionists may be allowed to wield a staff in combat.

### After Reaching 11th Level

An illusionist may build a stronghold, often a great tower. 1d6 apprentices of levels 1–3 will then arrive to study under the illusionist.

## Knight

**Requirements:** Minimum CON 9, minimum DEX 9
**Prime requisite:** STR
**Hit Dice:** 1d8
**Maximum level:** 14
**Armour:** Chainmail, plate mail, shields
**Weapons:** Melee weapons
**Languages:** Alignment, Common

Knights are warriors who serve a noble house or knightly order, carrying out their liege’s command and upholding the honour of the liege at all costs. They are masters of heavily armoured, mounted combat, preferring the lance above all other weapons. Knights are often members of the noble classes, but a person of lowlier origin may be initiated as a knight as a reward for noble deeds.

**Knighthood:** Knights of 1st and 2nd level are known as “squires” and are not yet regarded as true knights. Upon reaching 3rd level, the character is knighted by their liege and gains the right to bear a coat of arms (typically emblazoned upon the knight’s shield).

**Alignment:** A knight must have the same alignment as their liege.

### Chivalric Code

Knights are bound by a stringent code of honour, which they strive to uphold in all their deeds. A knight does not earn any experience points for deeds performed at odds with this code. The fundamentals of this code are:

- Preference of death over dishonour;
- Service of the knight’s liege as the greatest honour;
- Glory in single combat;
- Defence to the death of any in the knight’s charge;
- Honouring superiors;
- Respect of equals;
- Demanding obedience from inferiors;
- Scorning the ignoble.

**Dishonour:** A knight who brings dishonour upon themselves or their liege (this may include changing alignment) may have their knighthood revoked. In this case, the character becomes a fighter of equivalent level. It may be possible to regain the status of knighthood by performing a special quest.

### Combat

Knights can use all melee weapons but cannot use missile weapons (they regard these as dishonourable). They can wear any metal armour but scorn non-metal armour as only suitable for peasants and villains.

**Prowess of arms:** Knights regard armour as a symbol of prowess and status, always favouring the most impressive and impervious-looking armour available.

**Single combat:** In a battle, a knight must attack the most powerful or worthy foe in single combat.

### Flying Mounts

A knight of 5th level or higher can train fantastic, flying monsters as mounts. This takes one month. In general, a knight may train flying monsters of Hit Dice at most equal to the knight’s level. The use and training of flying monsters as mounts is at the referee’s discretion.

### Horsemanship

**Assessing steeds:** Knights are expert riders and can assess the worth of any steed. This allows a knight to determine whether an animal has low, average, or high hit points for its type.

**Urging great speed:** From 5th level, a knight can urge their steed to great speed, increasing its movement rate by 30’ (10’) for up to 6 turns, once per day.

* Modifiers from CON no longer apply.

### Hospitality

A knight of 3rd level or higher can expect hospitality and aid from nobles and other knights of the same alignment or social affiliation (e.g. order, religion, noble house, etc.). A knight is expected to extend such hospitality in kind.

### Mounted Combat

Knights gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls when mounted.

### Strength of Will

Fear: Knights are immune to all supernatural fear effects. From 3rd level, companions within 10’ of the knight gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against fear effects, and retainers and mercenaries under the knight’s command within 10’ gain a +2 bonus to loyalty or morale.

### Beguilement

Knights gain a +4 bonus to saving throws against hold spells, charms, mind control, hypnotism, suggestion, etc. They gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against illusion, and gain a saving throw (one is not normally allowed) against sleep spells.

### Stronghold

Any time a knight of 3rd level or higher wishes (and has sufficient money), they can build a castle or stronghold and control the surrounding lands. The permission of the knight’s liege is always required.

### After Reaching 9th Level

A knight may be granted a title such as Baron or Baroness. The land under the knight’s control is then known as a Barony.

## Magic-User

Requirements: None
Prime requisite: INT
Hit Dice: 1d4
Maximum level: 14
Armour: None
Weapons: Dagger, staff (optional)
Languages: Alignment, Common

Magic-users are adventurers whose study of arcane secrets has taught them how to cast spells. Magic-users are able to cast a greater number of increasingly powerful spells as they advance in level.

### Arcane Magic

See Magic, p122 for full details on arcane magic.

Magical research: A magic-user of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When a magic-user reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items.

Spell casting: Magic-users carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The spell casting chart (opposite) shows both the number of spells in the magic-user’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st level magic-user has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to magic-users is found on p131.

Using magic items: As spell casters, magic-users are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands).

### Combat

Magic-users can only use daggers and are unable to use shields or wear any kind of armour. This makes them very vulnerable in combat.

#### Magic-Users and Staves (Optional Rule)

Optionally, magic-users may be allowed to wield a staff in combat.

### After Reaching 11th Level

A magic-user may build a stronghold, often a great tower. 1d6 apprentices of levels 1–3 will then arrive to study under the magic-user.

## Paladin

### Requirements

Minimum CHA 9
Prime requisite: STR and WIS
Hit Dice: 1d8
Maximum level: 14
Armour: Any, including shields
Weapons: Any
Languages: Alignment, Common

Paladins are warriors sworn by sacred oath to the service of a Lawful holy order.

### Alignment

A paladin must be lawful.
If the character's alignment ever changes (for any reason), they lose all class abilities and become a fighter of the same level. The referee may allow the character to perform a quest of atonement in order to regain their status as a paladin.

### Prime requisites

A paladin with at least 13 in one prime requisite gets +5% to experience. If both STR and WIS are 16 or higher, the paladin gets a +10% bonus.

### Combat

Paladins can use all types of weapons and armour.

### Divine Magic

See Magic, p122 for full details on divine magic.

**Holy symbol:** A paladin must carry a holy symbol (see the equipment list).

**Deity dis favour:** Paladins must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment and religion. Paladins who fall from favour with their deity may incur penalties.

**Spell casting:** From 9th level, a paladin may pray to receive spells. The power and number of spells available to a paladin are determined by the character's experience level. The list of spells available to paladins is found on p128 (paladins have the same spell selection as clerics).

### Holy Resistance

Paladins are immune to all disease.

### Laying on Hands

Once per day, a paladin can heal 2 hit points per level by laying their hands on wounded characters. Additionally, a paladin of 5th level or higher may cure disease once per week by laying on hands.

### Turning the Undead

Paladins of 3rd level and higher can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters encountered. To turn the undead, the player rolls 2d6. The referee then consults the table opposite, comparing the roll against the HD of the type of undead monsters targeted.

#### Successful Turning

If the turning attempt succeeds, the player must roll 2d6 again to determine the number of HD affected (turned or destroyed).

**Turned undead:** Will leave the area, if possible, and will not harm or make contact with the paladin.

**Destroyed undead:** Are instantly and permanently annihilated.

**Excess HD and minimum effect:** Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a monster are wasted. However, at least one undead monster will always be affected on a successful turning.

**Mixed groups:** If turn undead is used against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.

### After Reaching 9th Level

With the permission of their holy order, a paladin can build a castle or stronghold and control the surrounding lands. The paladin may be granted a title such as Baron or Baroness. The land under their control is then known as a Barony.

## Vow of Humility

A paladin may keep only a total of one suit of magical armour, one magical shield, and one magical melee weapon. They must also donate 10% of all income to a Lawful religious institution.

## Warhorse

A paladin of 4th level or higher may summon a holy charger—a warhorse with AC 5 [14], 5+5 HD, and a movement rate of 180’ (60’). If the horse dies, another may not be summoned for 10 years.

† At the referee’s option, the table may be expanded to include more powerful types of undead monsters.

## Ranger

**Requirements:** Minimum CON 9, minimum WIS 9

**Prime requisite:** STR

**Hit Dice:** 1d8

**Maximum level:** 14

**Armour:** Leather, chainmail, shields

**Weapons:** Any

**Languages:** Alignment, Common

Rangers are members of a secret society which protects their native lands from invasion and the influence of Chaos. They are skilled warriors who are adapted to life in the wilds. At higher levels, their connection with nature grants them the ability to cast spells.

**Alignment:** As protectors, rangers may only be lawful or neutral. If a ranger ever changes alignment to chaotic, they lose all special class abilities and become a fighter of the same level. The character may be able to regain their ranger status by performing a special quest.

### Awareness

Rangers are only surprised on a roll of 1. This may mean that a ranger is able to act in the surprise round while their companions are surprised.

### Combat

Rangers can use all types of weapons and can use leather armour, chainmail, and shields. Because of their need for stealth, they cannot use plate mail.

### Divine Magic

See Magic, p122 for full details on divine magic.

**Spell casting:** From 8th level, due to a deep connection with nature, a ranger gains the ability to cast spells. The power and number of spells available to a ranger are determined by the character’s experience level. The list of spells available to rangers is found on p129 (rangers use the druid spell list).

### Foraging and Hunting

A party with a ranger succeeds at foraging with a 2-in-6 chance and finds prey when hunting with a 5-in-6 chance (see Wilderness Adventuring, p224).

### Limited Possessions

A ranger may only keep wealth and possessions that can be kept on their person or mount. Excess must be donated to worthy causes (not other PCs!).

### Pursuit

When the ranger’s party pursues an opposing group in the wilderness (see Evasion and Pursuit, p230), the chance of evasion is reduced by 10%.

### Stealth

In the wilderness, a ranger has a 3-in-6 chance of hiding and a 3-in-6 chance of moving silently.

D: Death / poison; W: Wands;
P: Paralysis / petrify; B: Breath attacks;

## Tracking

Rangers can identify and follow tracks. This skill improves as the character gains levels (see the table to the right). Success may be modified by the following factors:

* Soft/hard ground: +20% to -50%.
* Size of group being tracked: +2% per creature beyond the first.
* Passing through an area where other tracks mingle: -50%.
* Age of tracks: -5% per 12 hours.
* Rainfall: -25% per hour.
* Efforts made to hide tracks: -25%.

### After Reaching 10th Level

2d12 beings will join the ranger as followers. The nature of these followers is up to the referee—they may include human or demi-human adventurers, animals, fantastic mounts, sylvan creatures, or special monsters. If any of the followers die, they are not replaced.

## Ranger Tracking Chance of Success

| Level | Tracking |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | 20%      |

## Svirfneblin

### Demihuman Class

**Requirements:** Minimum CON 9
**Prime requisite:** STR
**Hit Dice:** 1d6
**Maximum level:** 8
**Armour:** Any appropriate to size, including shields
**Weapons:** Any appropriate to size
**Languages:** Alignment, Common, Deepcommon, Gnomish, Dwarvish, Kobold, the language of earth elementals

Short, thickset demihumans with long noses and gnarled, hairless, grey skin. Svirfneblins (also known as *deep gnomes*) are subterranean cousins of the gnomes who live close to the surface. Svirfneblins are skilled tunnellers and makers of mechanical contraptions and cunning secret doors. They love gems above all else and excavate their communities around veins of precious stones. Svirfneblins are typically around 3½′ tall and weigh around 120 pounds.

### Defensive Bonus

Due to their small size, svirfneblins gain a +2 bonus to Armour Class when attacked by large opponents (greater than human-sized).

### Detect Construction Tricks

As expert tunnellers, svirfneblins have a 2-in-6 chance of being able to detect new construction, sliding walls, or sloping passages when searching.

### Illusion Resistance

Svirfneblins gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws against illusions.

### Infravision

Svirfneblins have infravision to 90′ (see *Darkness*, p220).

### Blend into Stone

Svirfneblins have the uncanny ability to go unnoticed when in an environment of natural or carved stone so long as they remain silent and motionless. The chance of success is 4-in-6 in gloomy conditions or 2-in-6 in well-lit conditions.

### Combat

Svirfneblins can use all types of armour. Armour must be tailored to svirfneblins' small size. Likewise, svirfneblins can only use weapons appropriate to their stature (as determined by the referee). They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

## Svirfneblin Level Progression

| Level | XP     | HD   | THAC0       | D  | W  | P  | B  | S  |
|-------|--------|------|-------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1     | 0      | 1d6  | 19 [0]     | 8  | 9  | 10 | 14 | 11 |
| 2     | 2,400  | 2d6  | 19 [0]     | 8  | 9  | 10 | 14 | 11 |
| 3     | 4,800  | 3d6  | 19 [0]     | 8  | 9  | 10 | 14 | 11 |
| 4     | 10,000 | 4d6  | 17 [+2]    | 6  | 7  | 8  | 11 | 9  |
| 5     | 20,000 | 5d6  | 17 [+2]    | 6  | 7  | 8  | 11 | 9  |

| 7     | 80,000 | 7d6  | 14 [+5]    | 4  | 5  | 6  | 9  | 7  |
| 8     | 160,000| 8d6  | 14 [+5]    | 4  | 5  | 6  | 9  | 7  |

D: Death / poison; W: Wands;
P: Paralysis / petrify; B: Breath attacks;
S: Spells / rods / staves.

## Light Sensitivity

When in bright light (daylight, continual light), svirfneblins suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a -1 penalty to AC.

## Speak with Earth Elementals

Svirfneblins can speak the grinding, growling tongue of natives of the elemental plane of earth.

## Stone Murmurs

Svirfneblins can understand the imperceptible grumblings of stone. If a svirfneblin stands quietly for one turn with their ear pressed against a stone surface, they have a 2-in-6 chance of divining one of the following pieces of information (player’s choice):

- The presence of secret doors in the stone, within 10'.
- The presence of gems or precious metals, up to 30' beyond the surface.
- The presence of living creatures, up to 30' beyond the surface.
- The presence of bodies of water or open spaces, up to 60' beyond the surface.

## Using Magic Items

Svirfneblins can use all magic items (except for spell scrolls) which deal with summoning or controlling earth elementals. This includes items that can normally only be used by spell casters.

## After Reaching 8th Level

A svirfneblin may construct a subterranean stronghold that will attract svirfneblins from far and wide.

Because of svirfneblins' connection with earth elementals, 1d3 16 HD earth elementals (see Conjure Elemental, p204) will live in the rocks around the stronghold and will be friendly with the svirfneblins. They may warn of intruders, carry messages and news, etc. The elementals will also protect the svirfneblins in times of grave danger. However, in exchange a svirfneblin ruler must always defend earth elementals within the svirfneblins' territory.

Svirfneblin rulers can hire members of other races in the capacity of retainers or specialists, but only soldiers of svirfneblin stock may be hired.

## THIEF

### Requirements:
None

### Prime requisite:
DEX

### Hit Dice:
1d4

### Maximum level:
14

### Armour:
Leather, no shields

### Weapons:
Any

### Languages:
Alignment, Common

Thieves are adventurers who live by their skills of deception and stealth. Their range of unique skills makes them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves are not always to be trusted.

**Adjust ability scores:** During character creation, thieves may not lower STR.

### Back-Stab

When attacking an unaware opponent from behind, a thief receives a +4 bonus to hit and doubles any damage dealt.

### Combat

Because of their need for stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armour heavier than leather and cannot use shields. They can use any weapon.

### Read Languages

A thief of 4th level or higher can read non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 80% probability. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular text again before gaining an experience level.

### Scroll Use

A thief of 10th level or higher can cast arcane spells from scrolls. There is a 10% chance of error: the spell does not function as expected and creates an unusual or deleterious effect.

### Thief Skills

Thieves can use the following skills, with the chance of success shown opposite:

| Skill                       | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Climb sheer surfaces (CS)   | A roll is required for each 100’ to be climbed. If the roll fails, the thief falls at the halfway point, suffering falling damage.              |
| Find or remove treasure traps (TR) | A roll is required to find a treasure trap and then another to remove it. This may be attempted only once per trap.                        |
| Hear noise (HN)             | In a quiet environment (e.g. not in combat), a thief may attempt to listen at a door or to hear the sounds of something (e.g. a wandering monster) approaching. |
| Hide in shadows (HS)        | Requires the thief to be motionless—attacking or moving while hiding is not possible.                                                           |
| Move silently (MS)          | A thief may attempt to sneak past enemies unnoticed.                                                                                             |
| Open locks (OL)             | Requires thieves’ tools (see Equipment, p94). A thief can only try this skill once per lock. If the roll fails, the thief may not try the same lock again before gaining an experience level. |
| Pick pockets (PP)           | If the victim is above 5th level, the thief’s roll is penalised by 5% for every level above 5th. There is always at least a 1% chance of failure. A roll of more than twice the percentage required for success means that the attempted theft is noticed. The referee should determine the reaction of the victim (possibly using the reaction table under Encounters, p228). |

### After Reaching 9th Level

A thief can establish a thief den, attracting 2d6 apprentices of 1st level. These thieves will serve the character with some reliability; however, should any be arrested or killed, the PC will not be able to attract apprentices to replace them. A successful thief might use these followers to start a Thieves’ Guild.

## Rolling Skill Checks

Hear noise: Is rolled on 1d6. If the roll is within the listed range of numbers, the skill succeeds.

Other skills: Are rolled on %, with a result of less than or equal to the listed percentage indicating success.

## Player Knowledge

The referee should roll for hear noise, hide in shadows, and move silently on the player’s behalf, as the thief does not immediately know if the attempt was successful. If a hide in shadows or move silently roll fails, the referee knows that the thief has been noticed and should determine enemies’ actions appropriately.
