# Campaign Start

## Starting Health

All human and common demi-human characters in the world have an extra 1d4 racial hit points, rolled upon character creation. Characters, typically commoners without a class, only rely on these racial hit points. The racial hit points have a minimum of 1 hit point.

Some demi-human races use a different die for their racial hit points, typically based on size and hardiness (tiny 1, small 1d2, large 1d8, huge 2d6). For monsters, this racial health is part of their Hit Dice as indicated in their stat block.

All characters that start at 1st level or higher in a class take maximum hit points at 1st level. At higher levels, Hit Dice are rolled as normal.

## Starting Spells

When creating a new character with Arcane or Divine Spellcasting, the player must choose four player-favorite spells of the first level and roll d4 to randomly pick which spell they start with. The choice can be made only from the **Player’s Tome;** unique and custom spells exist, but they must be found or researched during the game. If the player does not like the rolled result, they can take Sleep (as an arcane spellcaster) or Cure Light Wounds (as a divine spellcaster).

If they know more than one beginning spell (**Advanced Spell Book Rules**, pg. 124), they must roll randomly for those bonus spells on the complete list for any spell level they can cast, using an appropriately sized die (d6, d8, or d12). Duplicate rolls are rerolled until each beginner spell is unique.

**When a Magic User or Cleric attains a new level that adds new slots or unlocks access to a new spell level, they do not get a free spell like in modern-sensibilities games.** They must find a teacher or site of worship and access to scrolls, spell books, or holy texts to gain a new spell via copying. Alternatively, they may research the spell, which typically costs 1000 gp per spell level and takes two weeks of training, practice, or devout worship.

## Alignment

The meaning of alignment has changed. Lawful and Chaotic represent powerful inclinations that align your character with the otherworldly forces of Law and Chaos, and actions that conflict with your alignment are considered anathema. Alignment anathema may still be transgressed under duress but requires character development and atonement for your acts, which is unnecessary for neutral characters. Extraordinary roleplay of your alignment may grant you divine interventions or a role in the grand conflict between Law and Chaos. Alignment languages are no longer languages but the ability to sense the motive and context of a character’s actions of the exact alignment. You only must choose a Lawful alignment if you play a Cleric or a Paladin.

Most humans and demi-humans are neutral by birth, driven by their self-centered needs and personal goals. Even among adventurers, about 70% of all characters will be neutral; if you wish to leave it to chance, make a d20 roll and pick another alignment if you roll 15+. The frequency is as low as 95% among non-adventurers and ordinary men; roll for a nat 20 if you consider your character such. Lawful Clerics and their Paladins (and similar classes with alignment requirements) can choose to be Neutral but are required by their stature to act as Lawful. Such characters may never benefit from Divine Interventions and similar extraordinary circumstances.

### Magic User’s Grogs

The Cleric and the Magic User (and other pure spellcasting classes approved by the DM) may choose to start their career with a “grog”, a mercenary hireling of one-third the player character’s hit dice (rounded; usually 1 HD for player levels 1–4) who is sworn to protect them during the early days when they can cast only one or a few spells per day. The player should build a strong bond and motivation between the two characters. The hireling does not need to be paid a wage but should be treated fairly and supported in their needs. The grog benefits from a +2 modifier to Morale, and all rules for sharing treasure and experience apply to it as normal (see [Hirelings](https://www.notion.so/Hirelings-a4a611493d2c4c2c91ec703166514b4b?pvs=21)). If the grog dies, it is not replaced; the spellcaster must hire a new hireling like everyone else if they wish to continue receiving personal protection.

## Class Rework

## Basics of Class Rework

Classes are broken into three distinctive groups:

- **Basic Classes —** These include the Cleric, the Fighter, the Magic User, and the Thief. **All Basic Classes have the standard Primary Attribute Requirements of 9.** With minor improvements to their role, these classes are left unchanged.
- **Demihuman Classes —** These include the Drow, the Dwarf, the Duergar, the Elf, the Gnome, the Halfling, the Half-Elf, the Half-Orc, and the Svirnefblin. **Their primary Attribute Requirements are all increased to 11.** These classes are rebalanced with a boost of their unique abilities over human characters. Any class from a third party supplement that is a demihuman class follows the same rules and is a subject of improvement by the DM, if needed.
- **Advanced Classes —** These include the Acrobat, the Assassin, the Barbarian, the Bard, the Druid, the Illusionist, the Knight, the Paladin, and the Ranger. **The primary Attribute Requirements for advanced classes are all increased to 13.** These classes are rebalanced with significant boosts to their power and uniqueness to represent prestige classes your character may occasionally pick. Any class from a third party supplement that is a special uncommon human class class follows the same rules and is a subject of significant improvement by the DM, if needed.

For each class, combine the write-up in the **Old School Essentials Advanced Player's Tome** with the changes and additions listed here.

## Basic Classes

## Cleric

- The Cleric can use holy water and prayer to alleviate and stop the spread of disease. The Cleric has a 4-in-6 chance to cure simple diseases and a 2-in-6 chance to cure simple virulent diseases; the check can be repeated daily for normal diseases, or weekly for virulent diseases. The cleric has a 1-in-6 chance to attempt to cure magical or unholy diseases or potent diseases with no known or simple cure; if they can do so, they must use their Turn Undead vs a disease with an HD value decided by the DM (for example, the Black Plague is a 5 HD disease). If Turning is successful, the disease stops developing, and another successful Turning on another day is needed to cure it. If Destruction is successful, the disease is cured. If cured, the patient recovers in 3d6 days after receiving the cure, or half that if they are believers of the same faith or alignment.
- **Holy Sense:** The Cleric can concentrate for one turn on a held item or on an area to tell if it is magical by divine means and whether the item is holy, unholy, or a divine artifact of any alignment, and its properties if the item is holy based on their beliefs. The Cleric can also concentrate on a 30-foot area and tell if it is consecrated or desecrated based on their beliefs. The Cleric can reveal divine artifacts, items made by divinely aligned creatures, intelligent items with an alignment, or cursed items (although the specifics of the curse cannot be revealed).

## Fighter

- The Fighter can cleave through multiple enemies in melee range. On their turn, when the Fighter reduces an enemy to 0 hp with a melee attack, they can make one additional melee attack against another opponent they are engaged with. They learn to cleave twice at 5th level, three times at 9th level, and four times at 13th level. After 9th level, the Fighter can spend one use of cleave to move no more than 5 feet and engage another enemy.

## Magic User

- The Magic User does not get access to weapon proficiencies from Rules Cyclopedia.
- **Arcane Sense.** The Magic User can concentrate on a held item for one turn to tell if it is magical by arcane means and its properties. Cursed items never reveal their curse until the item is used correctly. If the item is intelligent, the Magic User may confirm that and evaluate a vague approximation of the intelligence (below, at par, or above theirs).

> 👉🏼 The Magic User’s ability to detect magic items does not make the **Read Magic** spell useless. The spell is cast in a round; it identifies things that are not held items, such as terrain and hidden magical traps, and has no limit on the number of items it can detect. Still, the **Read Magic** spell does not identify an item’s properties.

## Thief

- Thief Skills use a modified version of the Optional Thief rules in Carcass Crawler #1 (pg. 28) but converted to support percentile values as supported by the Foundry system.
  - At Level 1, the Thief has a value of 10% in all its skills (25% in Climb) and 1-1 in its Hear Noises Skill. The Thief then distributes 4 increases between these skills. Each increase adds +15% to the skill's percentile value or +1 to the lower value of an X-in-6 for Hear Noises. You may not put more than two increases in the same skill.
  - At gaining a new level, the Thief can distribute two additional increases. You may not put more than one increase in the same skill.
  - Percentile skills cannot exceed a maximum of 85%; value reached with 5 increases. The Hear Noises skill cannot exceed a maximum of 5-in-6; the value reached with 4 increases.
- Under the standard rules, checks to search for traps or secret doors, remove treasure traps, and open locks may only be attempted once per character. The DM may allow repeated checks at the expense of time: one turn per attempt. Spending extra time brings its risks in the form of wandering monsters and diminishing resources (e.g., light)

> 🔦 The Thief may increase their chances in a percentile skill by +10 or +20 if they use environmental factors such as shadows and light sources or engage in competence roleplay of situations where wrong decisions and poor use of real-life knowledge may cause failure.

## Demi-human Classes

The minimum attribute requirement for all demi-human classes is 11.

## Drow

- The Drow is trained in the art of assassination in darkness. When attacking in pitch darkness, the Drow benefits from +4 to Attack Roll against unaware or blinded creatures. However, when attacking, the Drow may forfeit this bonus and deal double damage on a successful hit.
- The Drow is trained in dark-elven combat techniques that emphasize speed and accuracy. When they use weapons made by Drow, they can choose to have their Dexterity Bonus, rather than their Strength Bonus, added to the Attack and Damage Rolls.
- The Drow can spend a day in the company of friendly poisonous spiders of 1 HD or more and produce 1d3 uses of Bloodstream Poison Type I or Ingested Poison Type II. For each 3 HD above the first in spider hit dice, increase the type of poisons by one type category. The Drow cannot repeat the process with the same spider population in a week.
- The Drow’s **Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis** has been changed to **Immunity to Sleep and Paralysis.** Spells or creature attacks cannot put the Drow to sleep or paralyze them. However, they can be petrified by creatures such as Basilisks or Medusas.
- **Sylvan Sense.** The Drow can concentrate for one turn on a held item to determine its magical status by arcane means but cannot reveal its properties; only a Magic User, Illusionist, and sometimes a Cleric can do this.

## Dwarf

- Once per day, the Dwarf can reroll a failed saving throw versus Death or Poison, Paralysis or Petrification, or Spells (but not Rods and Staves).
- The Dwarf gains +1 hit point every time they level up after 1st level. The Dwarf rolls their hit dice twice when leveling up and chooses the higher result (and can still reroll a result of 1 or 2 once).
- The Dwarf has **Attack Giant Foes**. Against giant opponents (larger than human-sized), they benefit from +2 to attack rolls.

## Duergar

- Once per day, the Duergar can reroll a failed saving throw versus Poison or Spells.
- Duergar’s **Stealth** applies to all stone-made interiors with exposed rough stonework, not just underground.
- **Harm Giant Foes:** Against giant opponents (larger than human-sized), they benefit from +2 to damage.

## Elf

- The Elf loses **Infra-vision 90’**. Among elves, it is available only to the Drow. The Elf gains Low Light Vision (see [Low-Light Vision](https://www.notion.so/Low-Light-Vision-47b310049e314f2bbbe5c4294fe904f3?pvs=21)).
- The Elf’s **Arcane Magic** grants it access to the spell lists of both the Magic User and Illusionist. The Elf also gains two additional Beginner Spells, rolled as normal.
- The Elf is trained in elven combat techniques that emphasize speed and accuracy. When using weapons made by elves, the Elf can choose to have their Dexterity Bonus, rather than their Strength Bonus, added to the Attack and Damage Rolls.
- The Elf’s **Detect Secret Doors** is changed to **Detect Secrets**. The Elf has a 2-in-6 chance to detect hidden objects when actively searching. The Elf’s cunning intuition also has a 1-in-6 chance of knowing whether someone is keeping a secret from them, even without fact-checking. However, the Elf does not automatically know what the secret might be.
- The Elf’s **Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis** is changed to **Immunity to Sleep and Paralysis.** The Elf cannot be put to sleep or paralyzed by spells or creature attacks. However, they can be petrified by creatures such as Basilisks or Medusas.
- **Sylvan Sense.** The Elf can concentrate for one turn on a held item to determine its magical status by arcane means but cannot reveal its properties; only a Magic User, Illusionist, and sometimes a Cleric can do this.

## Gnome

- Once per day, when the Gnome takes damage from an enemy, they may become invisible until the start of their next turn or until they receive damage again before their next turn.
- The Gnome’s **Arcane Magic** allows them to choose between the Magic User and Illusionist spell lists. The choice is made upon character creation and cannot be changed later.
- The Gnome has a 4-in-6 chance to Hide in a densely forested environment, a 3-in-6 chance to hide in a crowded urban environment, and a 2-in-6 chance to Hide in a natural dungeon or furnished interior environment, and 1-in-6 chance if none of these apply. As long as enough cover is available, the Gnome can hide and remain hidden while they take no action. The chances increase by 1 if done in pitch darkness or under moonlight. The Gnome can remain hidden for 1d3 rounds; it must repeat the check to extend the period by an additional 1d3 rounds.

## Halfling

- The Halfling is born lucky. Once per day, they can reroll a failed saving throw or a d6 check to Hide (see below).
- The Halfling has a 5-in-6 chance to Hide in a densely forested environment, a 4-in-6 chance to hide in a crowded urban environment, and a 3-in-6 chance to Hide in a natural dungeon or furnished interior environment, and 1-in-6 chance if none of these apply. As long as enough cover is available, the Halfling can hide and remain hidden while they take no action. The Halfling can remain hidden for 1d3 rounds; it must repeat the check to extend the period by an additional 1d3 rounds.

## Half-Elf

- The Half-Elf loses **Infra-vision 90’**, among all elves it is available only on the Drow. The Half-Elf gains Low Light Vision (see [Low Light Vision](https://www.notion.so/Low-Light-Vision-47b310049e314f2bbbe5c4294fe904f3?pvs=21))
- The Half-Elf is trained in elven combat techniques that emphasize speed and accuracy. When using weapons made by elves or humans, the Half-Elf can choose to have their Dexterity Bonus, rather than their Strength Bonus, added to the Attack and Damage Rolls.
- The Half-Elf is a born diplomat. The Half-Elf gains +1 to Reaction Rolls from all creatures that do not bear hatred towards humans or elves.
- The Half-Elf’s **Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis** is changed to **Immunity to Sleep and Paralysis.** The Half-Elf cannot be put to sleep or paralyzed by spells or creature attacks. They can, however, be *petrified* by such creatures as Basilisks or Medusas.
- **Silvan Sense.** The Half-Elf can concentrate for one turn on a held item to determine its magical status by arcane means but cannot reveal its properties; only a Magic User, Illusionist, and sometimes a Cleric can do this.

## Half-Orc

- The Half-Orc gains Low Light Vision (see [Low Light Vision](https://www.notion.so/Low-Light-Vision-47b310049e314f2bbbe5c4294fe904f3?pvs=21))
- The Half-Orc racial die is d6.
- The Half-Orc’s hardiness defies death. When reduced to 0 hp, they do not fall unconscious but remain conscious and able to act until the end of the next round or until reduced to -10 hp.
- When Half-Orcs reduce their Constitution when they reach 0 hp or lower, they reduce by that amount minus one. On 5th and 9th level, the reduction increases by one.
- The Half-Orc’s unarmed attacks and unarmed combat techniques, such as grappling, deal 1d4 damage in addition to their other effects. However, the Half-Orc can choose not to deal this damage.

## Svirnefblin

- The Svirnefblin takes half the damage from falling on a rocky or earthy surface. When a Svirnefblin starts falling, and there’s a rock edge in reach, they may attempt to save vs. Breath attack and grab a rocky edge on success, avoiding a fall.

## Advanced Classes

The minimum attribute requirement for all advanced classes is 13.

## Acrobat

- **Acrobat Skills** use a percentile system modeled on Thief skills.
  - At Level 1, the Acrobat begins with the following values: Climb Sheer Surfaces 40%, Falling 25%, Tightrope Walking 40%, Hide in Shadows 10%, and Move Silently 10%.
  - At Level 1 the Acrobat does not distribute increases. At gaining a new level, the Acrobat can distribute two additional increases. You may not put more than one increase in the same skill. Each increase adds +15% to a chosen skill.
  - Climb Sheer Surfaces and Tightrope Walking may reach 100%. Falling, Hide in Shadows, and Move Silently may reach 70%.
- Once per day, the Acrobat can reroll a failed saving throw versus Breath or versus Spells, Wands and Staves as long as they are unimpeded to move, and are not surprised by the effect.
- Once per round, if an Acrobat is about to take damage from a successful attack, they roll a d4 and add the rolled result to their AC. If this causes the AC to become higher than the attack roll, the attack still hits but does only 1 hp of damage and no other effects, if any. The die size changes to d6 at the 5th level, d8 at the 9th level, and d10 at the 13th. The Acrobat does not benefit from Dodge die if they are prone, grappled, or their movement is impeded or slowed by external factors such as difficult terrain.
- When the Acrobat attacks, they make an FA skill check before the attack roll, or they can announce a Charge to make a tumbling attack. On success on the FA check or using a Charge, the attack, if successful, does double damage, and if the opponent is unaware of the attack, the attack benefits from +4 to hit. On failure of the FA check, the attack, if successful, makes only 1 point of damage (no damage roll is made), and the Acrobat cannot use a tumbling attack until the end of the encounter.

## Assassin

- The damage dealt when the target of an assassination succeeds on its save against instant death is doubled on the 5th, tripled on the 9th, and quadrupled on the 13th level. For each level above 9th, the target’s save against instant death check result is decreased by 1.
- The Assassin refers to the Thief’s custom rules for Climb, Hear Noises, and Move Silently. No change is made to Assassination skill.
  - The Assassin’s Climb skill matches the values of the Thief.
  - The Assassin starts with 2 increases at level 1. They get 1 increase on each level up.

## Barbarian

- **Barbarian Skills** use a percentile system modeled on Thief skills.
  - At Level 1, start at: Climb 25%, Hide in Undergrowth 10%, Move Silently 10%.
  - No increases at 1st level. Levels 2–9: **+1 increase per level**. Levels 10–14: **+2 increases per level**. Each increase is **+15%** to a chosen skill. Only 1 increase per skill per level.
  - **Caps:** Climb 85%; Hide in Undergrowth 70%; Move Silently 70%.
  - Result: exactly 18 total increases by 14th level; full caps are only reachable at high level, not midgame.
- The Barbarian reduces all damage taken by non-magical attacks by 1. This reduction increases to 2 at the 9th level. The damage taken cannot be reduced below 1.
- The Barbarian has sharpened all its senses in combat. When caught surprised, unaware, or blind-fighting, such as in pitch darkness, the benefit to hit enemies receive is reduced to +2 instead of +4. When surprised or in pitch darkness, the Barbarian can make a saving throw against Death to prevent damage against them from being doubled.
- When the Barbarian charges, in addition to +2 to the attack roll, they also benefit from +2 plus their Strength bonus for the damage roll. The Barbarian can also charge again after they reduce an enemy to 0 hp.

## Bard

- **Bard Skills** reflect the Bard’s subtlety and performance.
  - At Level 1, the Bard begins with Pick Pockets 10%, Move Silently 10%, Hide in Shadows 10%, and Hear Noise 1-in-6.
  - The Bard starts with 1 increase at 1st level. Starting with Level 2, the Bard gains 1 increase each level. Each increase adds +15% to a percentile skill or +1 to Hear Noise (max 5-in-6). Only 1 increase per skill per level.
  - Pick Pockets, Move Silently, and Hide in Shadows can reach 70%.
  - Hear Noise can reach 5-in-6.
- When rolling initiative, a Bard may choose to forgo movement this round and sing, or forgo making an attack this round and play an instrument. If they sing during the round, allies benefit from +2 to Morale Checks. If they play an instrument during the round, enemies that can hear the music suffer -2 to their attack rolls unless they attack the Bard.
- When the Bard charges and hits, they may choose to do 1 point of damage instead of rolling for damage. If they do, the target must save versus spell or be stunned, losing their next turn. Until they act again, attacks against the target benefit from +2 to hit.
- **Bardic Knowledge.** The Bard can concentrate for one turn on a subject, an object, or a person and has a 1-in-6 chance of knowing an obscure fact about them. There is an additional 2-in-6 chance that the fact will be helpful for the party and its goals, and on a roll of 6 on that secondary check, the fact is always wrong. The fact is never a direct solution or applicable hint to what actions the party must follow. Both checks are made by the DM, and the second roll is never revealed to the player. The first check improves to 2-in-6 at the 5th, 3-in-6 at the 9th, and 4-in-6 at the 13th level.

## Druid

- The Druid has a favored terrain, the region’s wilderness, which they have vowed to protect. With the blessing of their circle, a Druid may travel to discover new terrain in distress that they can vow to protect once they accomplish a deed to defend it.
- The Druid can make natural salves that stop bleeding and ease pain as long as they are within their favored terrain. The Druid can recover 1d3 hp to self or another living creature, and double the natural healing rate for the day. Each creature can benefit from this once per day.
- The Druid can use survival skills and natural means to cure weaker poisons. The Druid has a 5-in-6 chance to cure poison. The chance is lowered by 1-in-6 for each level of poison above level I. A chance of 0-in-6 makes it impossible to attempt a roll.
- The Druid suffers -4 to Morale checks to recruit and maintain service of non-animal retainers and hirelings, but +2 to Morale checks to encounter and recruit animal companions. Druids can calm animals and beasts (including dire beasts) with a +2 bonus to the Morale Check. Druids can be uncooperative at times and have difficulty communicating with civilized folk, and civilized folk often have a negative bias towards them.
- The Druid may start with an animal companion and recruit as many animals as possible up to their hireling limit. The animal companion should be native to their favored terrain, be treated as a henchman, and count against the limit. They should not make Morale checks (or use a Morale value of 10 if needed) or require anything beyond care and companionship. Each animal may have HD no higher than a third of the Druid’s HD, rounded up. If lost, a replacement animal companion can be found within 1d4 weeks per HD of the lost companion, provided the search occurs in the Druid's favored terrain. The DM decides the number of HDs of the companion using bestiary entries rather than the theoretical maximum allowed by these rules.

## Illusionist

- The Illusionist can spend one hour conjuring an illusion of a small object or tiny creature that appears natural at a cursory glance. The Illusionist must be intimately familiar with a real object or creature to create an illusion of it. It has a 3-in-6 chance to behave as expected, a 2-in-6 chance to feel genuine to touch, and a 1-in-6 chance to emit sound or smell that resembles the real thing; these are rolled when the illusion is created. As long as the illusion appears natural, any other creature needs to interact with the illusion (usually by touching it) and make a simple Wisdom check to disbelieve it for themselves. The illusion cannot deal damage or interact with other creatures that are not illusions; it is destroyed if any damage is dealt. The illusion appears as a magical effect to spells that detect magic. All illusions disappear when their creator loses consciousness (such as sleeping or being knocked out). The number of minor illusions an Illusionist can maintain at once is 2 plus their Intelligence modifier.
- Illusionists do not need to interact with an illusion; if they can see it, they can make a simple Wisdom check to disbelieve it for themselves (others are still subject to believe in it).
- The Illusionist can concentrate on a held item for one turn to determine if it is magical by arcane means and its properties. Cursed items never reveal their curse until they are appropriately used. The Illusionist can also focus on an item or area of up to 30 feet and sense if it is an illusionary object or location as long as the level of the illusion spell used to cast the illusion (or the maximum spell level available to its caster if not via a spell but a ritual or other grand magic of permanence) is equal or lower than the maximum spell level available to the Illusionist. For example, a 5th-level Illusionist can see through illusions cast by a slot up to the 3rd level and ritual illusions of other magic users and Illusionists of the 6th level and below.

## Knight

- The Knight’s social status cannot be lower than a landless Noble. If the player rolls for social status and does not like the result, they can become a landless Noble instead. The Knight also has a claim to an inheritance that the DM may interweave in their personal campaign goals; if the inheritance is claimed, the 9th-level keep becomes immediately available at the current level.
- The Knight can take two extra hirelings, and an additional one at 5th and 9th level. The Knight benefits from +2 to attract retainers and hirelings, +2 to interview them, and +1 to recognize their capabilities and statistics.
- The Knight can announce a shield stand before rolling the initiative each round, and precludes no movement this turn. The Knight’s benefit from using a shield increases from +1 to +2 to AC and +1 to Parry attack rolls until the start of the next turn.
- Once per encounter, the Knight can speak a passionate oath of the moment before they roll initiative on a round of their choice. This oath may taunt opponents of opposite alignment to focus their attacks on the Knight. Until the Knight remains standing, all hirelings have +2 to their Morale Checks.

## Paladin

- The Paladin gains one and a half times the XP reward for donated gold and treasure. While 10% is the required minimum, there is no maximum amount the Paladin can donate.
- **Dedication to Law and Good.** The Paladin has a +1 to attack rolls against inherently evil creatures with hit dice equal to or greater than theirs. They also deal +2 extra damage when they hit an inherently evil creature with hit dice less than theirs.
- The Paladin can taunt evil creatures able to reach and attack the Paladin within their next turn to draw their attention away from non-Paladin allies. High-intelligence evil creatures require a properly worded taunt to draw them to attack the Paladin against their interests.
- The Paladin can spend a turn concentrating to detect the presence of evil enchantments and creatures of evil alignment within 60’. Unlike the detect evil spell, this does not cause them to glow; it only gives the Paladin a confirmation of nearby presence. The Paladin can also hold an item or an intelligent weapon and sense if it is inherently evil or tainted by a greater evil.
- The Paladin is immune to common diseases. A common disease is a non-magical disease with a known cure or a chance of survival without a cure. The Paladin has a 2-in-6 chance to cure simple diseases and a 1-in-6 chance to cure simple virulent diseases with a lay of hand; the cured patient recovers in 3d6 days.

## Ranger

- The Ranger has a favored terrain, the wilderness of the region where they have been born or have lived most of their lives. The chosen favored terrain cannot be changed. They have trained all their life to protect the wilderness against two groups of common enemies: in temperate woods, these are goblinoids and orcs. The DM may change one or both of these groups if the common enemies of other terrains differ.
- **Ranger Skills** are tied to the Ranger’s favored terrain.
  - At Level 1, the Ranger begins with Hear Noise 1-in-6, Hide in Shadows 10%, and Move Silently 10%.
  - The Ranger starts with no increases at level 1. Starting with level 2, the Ranger gains 1 increase each level. Each increase adds +15% to a percentile skill or +1 to Hear Noise (max 5-in-6). Only 1 increase per skill per level.
  - Hide in Shadows and Move Silently can reach 70%.
  - These skills function only in the Ranger’s favored terrain.
- The Ranger’s requirement to donate has been removed. The only class required to donate is the Paladin, and they have additional benefits from that.
- The Ranger’s walking speed in their favored terrain increases by 10 feet when not impeded by armor, rugged terrain, or other circumstances.
- The Ranger has vowed an enmity against all races threatening their favored terrain, usually the woods. The Ranger may perform an assassination (similar to the Assassin class) against their common enemies, gaining +4 to attack rolls and dealing double damage if the enemies are unaware. They also have +1 to the damage rolls against their common enemies (does not stack with weapon specialization).
- The Ranger is always vigilant in their favored terrain, and when not distracted by any other tasks, they lower the party surprise chance, usually 2-in-6, to 1-in-6. If the Ranger spends an hour to create a hideout in their favored terrain, they can increase the enemy surprise chance, usually 2-in-6, to 3-in-6.
- Due to their uncouth nature, the Ranger suffers -2 to Morale checks when recruiting and maintaining service for non-animal retainers, and humanoid hirelings who do not live in or near their favored terrain. They have +2 to Morale checks when encountering animals and beasts (but not dire beasts, those only the Druid can calm) common to their favored terrain.

## Appendix 1 - Magic Senses

This table simplifies the different inherent magic senses that spellcasting classes have. Unless noted otherwise, each Magic Sense requires 1 turn (10 minutes of exploration) to use properly.

| Class | Held Item | Area, 30’ by default | Cursed Items | Intelligent Items | Illusions equal or below the caster level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cleric | Yes, if Holy or Divine Artifact, plus properties only if Divine and Holy to your belief/alignment | Yes, only if it is Consecrated or Desecrated | Yes, no specifics | Yes, and their alignment | No |
| Magic User | Yes, if Arcane, plus properties | No (use Detect Magic spell) | Yes, no specifics | Yes, and their intelligence | No |
| Drow | Yes, if Arcane, no properties | No | No | No | No |
| Elf | Yes, if Arcane, no properties | No | No | No | No |
| Illusionist | Yes, if Arcane, plus properties | Yes, only for illusions below or equal to the caster level | Yes, no specifics | No | Detected, does not need to interact |
| Paladin | Yes, if evil | Yes, 60’, only if Consecrated or Desecrated, and sense Evil | No | Yes, if evil | No |

> 🪄 Anyone with a practice of use (typically about a turn long) can identify magical weapons and armor with enchantment bonuses to attack, damage, or AC. Still, a magic user or an illusionist must recognize any other qualities of the magical item (such as passive or triggered abilities or additional damage) before they can be used.

- When you take damage and your hp becomes 0 or less, you drop unconscious and start dying, and the excess damage is deducted from your Constitution score, point for point. Record your modified Constitution score separately, but do not change your hit points modifier yet.

> 🎲 In Foundry, create a character ability in your character sheet and use its name to record your unmodified Constitution so you are quickly reminded of its maximum value later on.

- When your Constitution score is reduced as a result of taking damage and your hit points are 0, anytime you receive first aid, magical healing or healing potion, or natural healing (such as a salve), make a d20-roll-under Constitution check. If you make the save, you were still hanging on your dear life even if your hit points are 0, and the healing effect is applied. If you fail the save, you died before you could have been healed and are pronounced dead.
- Once combat is over, within one minute of starting dying any player character that is unconscious and starts receiving first aid lasting at least one turn makes the same Constitution save, and on success recovers 1 hp at the end of the turn receiving first aid. Retainers and henchmen have a 2-in-6 chance to regain 1 hp if they receive first aid, and the chance is modified by their Constitution bonus to hit points (minimum 0 in 6, maximum 5-in-6). Any other creature left without first aid will die.
- At the end of combat, recalculate your hit points using your changed Constitution score. If your modified Constitution score is 7 or below, the negative modifier to hit dice is also applied as a penalty to attack rolls and all saving throws. This doesn’t happen mid-combat but only after combat, when the adrenaline wears off.
- Also at the end of combat, you gain an injury that is for roleplaying purposes only and will remind you of the unfortunate events of this combat. Work with your DM on the specifics of the injury. If you lost 3 or fewer Constitution points this combat, the injury is minor and will fully heal once your Constitution score returns to normal. If you lost 4 or more Constitution points in this combat, the injury is severe and will never fully heal, although once your Constitution score returns to normal you will learn how to deal with it for the rest of your life.
- If your Constitution score reaches 0, you are decapitated. Spells that would prevent death or bring you back to life (or unlife, unless it doesn’t require a capable body) consider your body unusable.
- You recover 1 point of Constitution per week if your modified Constitution is 7 or less, and 1d3 points of Constitution per week if your modified Constitution is 8 or more. If you do not benefit from healing, you do not recover anything if your Constitution is 7 or less, or 1 point if your Constitution is 8 or more. Your modified Constitution cannot increase above your normal Constitution.

## Fire Damage

Burning Oil Flasks do 1 point of damage when they break after a successful hit and set a creature on fire. At the start of its turn, a burning creature takes 1d6 points of fire damage.

Burning Oil from a single flask usually keeps a creature burning for two consecutive rounds. Using multiple oil flasks to put a creature on fire has no cumulative effect on the creature's burning condition but resets the period of burning to two rounds.

## Skills

## Chapter 5: Skills (pg. 81-86)

## Beginning Skills (pg. 81)

Players do not select their skills for character creation. Instead, they receive blank slots that they can fill in anytime before making a skill or attribute check requested by the DM.

Anytime the DM asks for a specific skill check, you may announce that your character has always had this skill and spend a blank slot to get the skill before making a check. The DM may ask you to explain how your character attained this skill, and your reasoning expands on your character's backstory.

## Skills Use (New)

The DM chooses the difficulty of each skill check and announces it to the players. Most checks are Simple (easy to moderate) or Expert (challenging and demanding). Heroic Checks are only required against challenges that can only be attempted by characters of a specific class (such as Thief and Acrobat).

- **Simple Checks:** Characters who do not have the applicable skill make an ability check; a success on that check is always a partial success with minor complications or limited results, such as taking more time or shoddy work. Characters who have an applicable skill succeed without making a check and with success with no imperfections and complications. Characters with class skills succeed without making a check.
- **Expert Checks**: Characters who do not have the applicable skill cannot usually attempt the check, though the DM may allow a check at -5 to the ability score if the skill is something that does not require specialized training. Characters who have applicable skills make an ability check. Characters with a class skill succeed without making a check.
- **Heroic Checks**: Characters cannot make the check, even if they have an applicable skill. Only classes with an appropriate class skill can attempt an X-in-6 or percentile check as described in their skill.

Remember, only one check can be made in a situation as it applies to the situation, not a particular player’s ability to achieve the result (see Using Skills Together, pg. 86). If multiple players are acting together, such as trying to listen through a door, the ones who would succeed with the rolled result achieve the success.

## Clarified Skills

- **Deception (pg. 83)** — The Deception skill cannot be used without roleplaying a plausible lie. Success in the skill only internalizes a good lie and may provide the push to motivate the target to act upon your life.
- **Detect Deception (pg. 83)** — The Detect Deception skill cannot be used without the player explicitly stating what the player (not their character!) believes is the truth. A successful skill check allows the DM to confirm or refute that statement. This is intended to give a vague confirmation but not skip social roleplaying or discussions between players. Heroic success, however, may reveal the deceptive intentions of your examination's target.
- **Healing (pg. 83)** — You cannot heal a creature a second time unless a day has passed since your last Healing, or it has received 4 or more hit points damage in another combat encounter.
- **Stealth (pg. 85)** — This skill is only needed when needing to move silently or pass by enemies within sensory range with limited time to prepare; no skill is required to hide in a stationary way or with ample time to prepare. Most Stealth checks to move silently within enemy sensory range are typically Expert checks. Still, the legendary heists known from heroic fantasy are Heroic checks and only Thief's territory. Extraordinary success on a Stealth check, or success on a Move Silently check by a Thief, allows one to cover up for the failure or inability to attempt the check of one other party character.

## Improving Skills (pg. 86)

- You cannot spend slots to take the same skill twice until level 5 unless the skill has a different subject or area of competence, as listed in the skill description.
- On reaching level 5, you may take the same skill a second time to become an Expert. On reaching level 9, you may take the same skill a third time to become a Master.
- When taking the same skill a second time, your character becomes an Expert, and the expertise bonus is +3 instead of the listed +1. When taking the same skill a third time and your character becomes a Master, the expertise bonus is +6 instead of the implied +2.
- Rolling 1 on the d20 die results in Exceptional success. Exceptional results may give you more information, take much less time to achieve, or create masterpieces of craftsmanship.
- Becoming an Expert improves your chance of achieving exceptional results. On a natural d20 roll of 1, or if your d20 result is 10 points or more below your attribute plus your +3 expertise bonus, your result is exceptional. *For example, a character with an Intelligence of 15 is an Expert in Science (geology); they succeed on 18 or less, and if they roll 8 or less, they get exceptional success.*
- Becoming a Master makes almost all your successes exceptional. Your result is an exceptional success if your d20 result equals or below your unmodified attribute score (without applying the +5 expertise bonus). *For example, a character with an Intelligence of 15 is a Master in Science (geology); they succeed on 19 or less (20 is always a failure), and if they roll 15 or less, they get an exceptional success.*

> 👉🏼 Adventurers may rarely consider becoming an Expert or a Master worthy of focusing their limited skill slots on the same skill. However, these rules apply to NPCs that players may seek for their services. As a rule of thumb, Specialists are at least Experts in their field.

## Retraining Skills (New)

- Between adventures, you may spend 50 gp per character level and one month and turn one skill into a blank slot, ready to be filled during their next adventures. If you are an Expert or Master, the cost is increased to 100 gp and 150 gp per character level, and you receive back two or three slots, respectively. This assumes that your character has spent the time and money to train for an undisclosed skill that will be revealed at the appropriate moment during adventuring.

## Hirelings

## Changes to Hirelings

Retainers, also called Normal Men in Rules Cyclopedia, do not earn XP and are not entitled to a share of the treasure found unless such is negotiated. Retainers that are not paid extra or a tiny share usually have a -2 penalty to their Morale Checks.

Mercenaries, also called hirelings, have no limitation to their use. They can be brought to dungeons to adventure by the player’s side. They are paid a salary, entitled to a half share of treasure found, and gain experience (but separately from the players). If not paid in time for multiple consecutive weeks, mercenaries tend to degrade their Morale by up to -2 penalty and are likely to revolt or disband.

## Hireling Experience

When the party gains experience by killing monsters, the earned experience points are divided among the players and each player earns their share. Hirelings also earn experience points but not from the same pool as players. They have their own separate pool that is divided among the sum of all players and all the hirelings, and the hirelings receive their share from that pool. This is usually a smaller share of experience than those player characters get.

When the party gains gold and experience by dividing and selling treasure, hirelings are entitled to a half share. In this case, players and hirelings divide the same pool, and the more hirelings are included in the pool the less players are going to earn.

*Example: Five adventurers bring six hirelings. When a monster worth 1000 xp is killed, each adventurer earns 1000 / 5 = 200 xp. Hirelings earn 1000 / (5 + 6 = 11) = 91 xp. The monster’s treasure is worth 900 gp. The party divides treasure between players and hirelings; players split their pool first (900 / 5 = 180 gp each) and hirelings split their half-shares separately (hirelings take half of the treasure pool divided among them). In this example the arithmetic should be calculated step by step by the DM to determine exact shares.*

## Hireling Limit

The Charisma-based limit of the number of hired men applies to retainers (called Normal Men in Rules Cyclopedia) and hirelings (or mercenaries in Old School Essentials). Separately, each player has a hireling limit equal to 2 plus their Charisma bonus. The Knight is an exception to this rule and can hire 4 plus their Charisma bonus.

*Example: a typical adventurer with Charisma of 11 (+0) can hire 4 retainers, or 2 retainers and 2 hirelings.*

## Retainers (Normal Men)

All non-combatant adults have THAC0 of 19 (+0 to hit), Saving Throw of 16, and 1d4 hit points. Small children and young women have no combat proficiencies (thus having -4 to hit), a Saving Throw of 18, and only 1 hit point.

## Level 0 Hirelings

Many hirelings in the game will be Level 0 hirelings with limited real-world combat experience. A level 0 Hireling has all the features of their class but rolls their first HD instead of taking its maximum value, as adventurers and other level 1 class hirelings do. They must reroll if they roll the maximum value of the hit die, typically having below the average hp for the first level of their class.

An L0 hireling becomes an L1 hireling when it acquires 100 XP. When it gains its first level, a hireling changes its first hit die to its maximum value instead of the previously rolled value.

*Example: Harold, an L0 Fighter, rolled their first HD and got 2, so they have 2 HP. When Harold gains 100 XP and reaches L1, Harold's first HD becomes its maximum (d8), giving them 8 HP.*

## Environment

## Light

### Infravision (aka Old-School Darkvision)

Infravision only works in pitch darkness. If a creature with infravision is within range of a light source, the infravision is disabled until the creature is no longer within the range of a light source and not facing any light source.

Infravision only detects blotches of heat without any actual form, and rough silhouettes of environments where heat is present. They cannot read or notice fine details with infravision, such as recognizing monsters except by size, silhouette (differentiating two and four-legged form, or the difference between an orc and a goblin), and behavior (how they move). They cannot recognize any individual object or creature that does not emit a heat signature.

What the Drow sees in pitch dark room.

### Low Light Vision

Creatures with infravision also have low-light vision. Creatures with low light vision see twice as far in torchlight, up to 60 feet rather than 30 feet.  

### Moonlit Vision

In an open exterior where moonlight is present, if the moon cycle matches half-moon, three-quarters or full moon, the environment is considered dim light unless there is concealment (medium to thick woods, buildings casting shadows, etc.). In moonlit vision, everyone gains Low Light Vision, while creatures with low light vision see as if it were normal light.

## Level Up

## XP and Economy

This adventure uses an x10 faster leveling speed than old-school D&D to allow for several level-ups during a single adventure and the ability to progress into later tiers of the game within modern time constraints. The following changes apply:

- Characters earn 1xp for each 1sp (not 1gp!) of treasure secured during adventuring. Although the world economy and other factors may prevent them from converting all treasure into its nominal gold price, they will earn XP based on its nominal price.

## After Level 9

Upon gaining a new level past level 9, you may reroll your hit dice (typically limited to 9) and apply the new value to your maximum hit points if it is higher than your previous rolled value.

## Downtimes

## Life Time

- Each day of life outside of adventuring since the start of the adventuring career earns 1 XP. This includes a bit of training, occasional altercations, hardships, and events that happen to the character and their family. This experience is usually a reward for the player for surviving the adventure, based on the time between the previous and the next adventure; or a little bit of progress if the DM needs to move the timeline in the future but the character has not leveled up at all meanwhile.
- For every three levels of experience earned by the character, the gain of experience from such life events increases by 1 XP per day.

## Learn New Spells

Any class that can learn and cast spells gains XP when they learn a new spell they did not know already from sources such as discovered scrolls and spell books found while adventuring; spells received from other players do not provide XP. The XP earned is based on the type of spell learned:

- Common spells from the Old School Essentials Player's Tome provide XP equal to the spell's level multiplied by 50.
- Rare and unique spells from other sources, such as published supplements or created by the DM for the adventure, provide XP equal to the spell's level multiplied by 150, or more if the DM deems the spell extremely powerful or rare.

## Carousing

Once per session while in a civilized settlement, a player character may choose to **Carouse** to gain extra experience points. A PC that goes carousing must choose to spend a certain amount of gold pieces, limited by the size of the settlement. The result determines how much they spend and how much XP they gain.  Once carousing per week can be made, and in some settlements, the period may be extended to couple of weeks, or even a month due to lack of supplies.

> 🪙 The party may carouse in a non-player character’s honor, then pass the benefit of XP gained to that character. Typically, this is done to level up a newly taken character that needs to reach the experience required to level up compared to the rest of the party.

| **Settlement Size** | **GP Spent / XP Gained** |
| --- | --- |
| Village | 1d6 x 100 |
| Town | 1d8 x 150 |
| City | 1d10 x 200 |
| Metropolis | 1d12 x 250 |

- In any given settlement, carousers may choose to roll from any entry equal to or smaller than the size of the current settlement.
- If the amount of gold spent is more than the carouser’s level, they still gain the listed XP but must roll on the **Carousing Mishaps** table.
- If the die roll exceeds the carouser’s level, they still gain the listed XP but must roll on the **Carousing Mishaps** table.
- Thieves connected to a settlement’s organized crime element gain +2 on the Carousing roll. Friends of thieves gain +1.

**Carousing Mishaps (3d6)**

3 — You mistake a powerful numbing agent for beer in a fit of idiocy. Reduce CON by 1d4 for 1d3 days; you cannot speak coherently. This prevents spellcasting. A CON score below 1 results in death.

12 — You insult someone of importance in the settlement. Roll 2d6+INT. Results: 10+ a rival appreciates your temerity and grants you a boon; 7–9 the person refuses to contact you and your compatriots for 1d4 months; 6 or less the person actively seeks to physically, emotionally, or financially harm you.

13 — You were caught desecrating a temple and shouting blasphemies — roll 2d6+CHA. Success levels: 10+ choose one; 7–9 choose two; 6 or less all three. Possible outcomes include being run out of town; -2 to all social rolls; or a 1-in-6 chance that magical healing will harm instead of healing.

14 — Same as 13 (see above).

15 — Same as 13 (see above).

16 — Beaten and robbed. Lose all your personal effects, and you’re reduced to 1 hit point.

18 — You accidentally start a conflagration. Roll a d6 twice. First roll: 1–2 burn down your favorite inn; 3–4 some other den of ill repute is reduced to ash; 5–6 a big chunk of town goes up in smoke. Second roll: 1–2 no one knows it was you; 3–4 your fellow carousers know you did it; 5 someone else knows, perhaps a blackmailer; 6 everybody knows.

**PHILANTHROPY**

Once per session while in a civilized settlement, a PC may donate to philanthropic causes to gain extra experience points. A PC who participates in **Philanthropy** must choose to spend a minimum amount of GP, determined by the size of the settlement. In return, they receive 80% of the GP expended in XP.

**Philanthropy**

| **Settlement Size** | **Minimum GP Expenditure** |
| --- | --- |
| Village | 300 |
| Town | 600 |
| City | 1000 |
| Metropolis | 1500 |

Suppose the amount spent exceeds the minimum expenditure listed for a given settlement size. In that case, there is a chance that the populace either resents or appreciates the PC’s generosity. Roll on the **Philanthropic Consequences** Table.

**Philanthropic Consequences**

| **1d6** | **Result** |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The populace resents your wealth and condescending manner of spending it. -1 to social rolls in the settlement, and you may never practice philanthropy here again. | 5 | The populace lauds your generosity. +1 to social rolls in this settlement. |
| 2 | The populace appreciates the generosity but thinks your motives are self-serving. -1 to social rolls in the settlement. | 6 | Your name is recognized by everyone within 30 miles. +1 to social rolls within this area, and mundane goods are 10% cheaper. |
| 3-4 | The populace knows you by name in this settlement. |  |  |
