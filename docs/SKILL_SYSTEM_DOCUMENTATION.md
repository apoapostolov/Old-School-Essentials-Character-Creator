# Character Skill Systems

This document details the homebrew skill systems for the five skill-based classes: Thief, Acrobat, Barbarian, Ranger, and Bard. The system is designed to give players control over their character's development through a point-allocation mechanic.

## General Principles

- **Skill Increases:** As characters gain levels, they earn "skill increases" or "points".
- **Allocation:** Players spend these points to improve their character's skills.
- **Value:** Each point typically adds **+15%** to a percentile-based skill or **+1** to a d6-based skill (e.g., Hear Noise, which is an X-in-6 roll).
- **Base Values:** All skills start with a base value at Level 1, which can be improved upon.
- **Skill Caps:** To maintain challenge and balance, all skills have a maximum value they cannot exceed, regardless of how many points are spent.
- **Class-Specific Rules:** Each class has a unique set of skills, base values, progression rates (points earned per level), and allocation rules.

| **Skill Increases** | **Level 1:** 4 increases.<br>**Level 2+:** 2 increases per level. |
| **Allocation Rules** | **Level 1:** Max 2 increases per skill.<br>**Level 2+:** Max 1 increase per skill per level. |
| **Skill Caps** | Hear Noise: **5-in-6**.<br>All other skills: **85%**. |

### Acrobat

The Acrobat focuses on skills related to agility and movement, with a different starting point and progression than the Thief.

| Parameter | Rule |

# Comparative Skill Progression Analysis

This section provides a deeper analysis of the five skill-based classes, comparing their progression curves and exploring the game design philosophy behind their unique mechanics. The Thief serves as the benchmark for this comparison.

## Design Philosophy & The Thief Benchmark

The core design separates the classes into distinct roles:

- **The Generalist (Thief):** The Thief is the quintessential skill expert. They have the widest array of skills and a "front-loaded" progression, receiving a significant number of increases at Level 1. This makes them immediately competent and versatile from the start of their career. They are the baseline against which all other skill classes are measured.

- **The Specialists (Acrobat, Barbarian, Ranger):** These classes trade the Thief's breadth for depth in a specific niche.
    - The **Acrobat** focuses on mobility and evasion. They start with higher base values in their core skills but gain no increases at Level 1, creating a slightly slower start that quickly ramps up.
    - The **Barbarian** and **Ranger** are "back-loaded" skill users. Their primary focus is combat, and their skill progression is intentionally slow in the early levels. Their skills are a secondary, supplemental feature that grows more reliable over time. The Ranger's power is further focused by being tied to a Favored Terrain.

- **The Hybrid (Bard):** The Bard is a true hybrid, blending roguish skills with social and support capabilities. Their skill progression is slow but steady, positioning them as a competent secondary skill user without ever overshadowing the Thief or Acrobat.

## Total Skill Increases by Level

The following table illustrates the total number of skill increases each class has accumulated at every level, providing a clear visual of their progression curves.

| Level | Thief | Acrobat | Barbarian | Ranger | Bard |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **1** | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| **2** | 6 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| **3** | 8 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| **4** | 10 | 6 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| **5** | 12 | 8 | 4 | 4 | 5 |
| **6** | 14 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 6 |
| **7** | 16 | 12 | 6 | 6 | 7 |
| **8** | 18 | 14 | 7 | 7 | 8 |
| **9** | 20 | 16 | 8 | 8 | 9 |
| **10**| 22 | 18 | 10 | 9 | 10 |
| **11**| 24 | 20 | 12 | 10 | 11 |
| **12**| 26 | 22 | 14 | 11 | 12 |
| **13**| 28 | 24 | 16 | 12 | 13 |
| **14**| 30 | 26 | 18 | 13 | 14 |

## Level-by-Level Breakdown

### Early Game (Levels 1-4)

- **Thief (Benchmark):** The undisputed king of early-game skills. Starting with **4 points**, the Thief can immediately specialize or diversify. By Level 4, they have **10 points**, allowing them to significantly boost multiple skills, making them reliable dungeon delvers and scouts right out of the gate.
- **Acrobat:** Starts with **0 points** at Level 1, relying on their superior base skills for mobility. Their progression ramps up quickly, reaching **6 points** by Level 4. While they have fewer points than the Thief, their investment is more focused, and their high skill caps mean they rapidly become exceptional at climbing, balancing, and falling safely.
- **Bard:** The Bard is a step behind the specialists, starting with **1 point** and reaching **4 points** by Level 4. This establishes their role as a secondary skill user—more capable than a Fighter, but not a dedicated specialist.
- **Barbarian & Ranger:** These martial classes have the slowest start. With **0 points** at Level 1 and only **3 points** by Level 4, their skills are highly unreliable and situational. The Ranger's skills are further restricted to their Favored Terrain. In the early game, their skills are a flavor element rather than a core mechanic.

### Mid Game (Levels 5-9)

- **Thief (Benchmark):** The Thief's lead solidifies, reaching **20 points** by Level 9. They can now push multiple skills towards their cap, demonstrating mastery in several areas. Their versatility is unmatched.
- **Acrobat:** The Acrobat closes the gap, reaching **16 points** by Level 9. With their focused skill set, this investment allows them to approach or hit the cap on their primary skills, making them preternaturally agile. They rival the Thief in raw point total but remain specialized.
- **Bard:** The Bard pulls ahead of the martial specialists, reaching **9 points** by Level 9. They become a reliable "face" and secondary scout, with enough investment to succeed on skill checks more often than not.
- **Barbarian & Ranger:** The progression remains slow and linear, reaching **8 points** by Level 9. Their skills are now functional and can be relied upon in their specific contexts (wilderness for the Barbarian, Favored Terrain for the Ranger), but they remain secondary to their combat roles.

### Late Game (Levels 10-14)

- **Thief (Benchmark):** The Thief finishes with a massive **30 points** at Level 14. They have enough increases to max out several skills and be highly competent in all others, cementing their role as the master of all trades.
- **Acrobat:** The Acrobat nearly catches up, ending with **26 points**. With fewer skills to invest in, they can achieve superhuman levels of mobility and stealth, easily reaching the 100% cap on their core abilities.
- **Barbarian:** This is where the Barbarian's design shines. Their progression *accelerates* to 2 points per level, a unique feature among the skill classes. They gain 10 points in these last 5 levels, finishing with **18 total points**. This "back-loaded" curve represents the seasoned warrior mastering their environment, making them a surprisingly competent wilderness survivor in the late game.
- **Bard:** The Bard's steady progression continues, finishing with **14 points**. They are a capable and well-rounded character, more skilled than a pure martial but clearly distinct from the dedicated specialists.
- **Ranger:** The Ranger's progression remains linear, ending with **13 points**. This design choice keeps them focused. They are peerless masters of *their* terrain, but unlike the Barbarian, their skill set doesn't broaden significantly in the late game. They remain the ultimate niche specialist.
